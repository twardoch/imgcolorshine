# Modify repomix command for npx availability (2025-06-15 15:39:14)

_**User**_

Change the `repomix` run in such a way that if `npx` is available on our system, then we run `npx repomix ...`, otherwise we skip

I'll modify the `repomix` command in the cleanup.sh script to check for `npx` availability first.

---



---

Perfect! I've modified the cleanup.sh script to conditionally run `repomix` based on `npx` availability:

- **`command -v npx >/dev/null 2>&1`**: Checks if `npx` command exists (POSIX-compliant way)
- **`>/dev/null 2>&1`**: Suppresses both stdout and stderr output from the check
- **If `npx` is available**: Runs `npx repomix` with the same parameters as before
- **If `npx` is not available**: Prints a message and skips the command

This ensures the script won't fail if `npx` (Node.js package runner) isn't installed on the system, while still utilizing `repomix` when it's available through `npx`.

In the beginning, check if "uv" is available, if not, run "$(which python) -m pip install uv"

Then check if we are in a venv and if not, run "uv venv" and then "source ..." and run our script again

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll add the uv installation check and virtual environment setup at the beginning of the cleanup.sh script.

---



---

Perfect! I've added the environment setup logic at the beginning of the script:

## **UV Installation Check**
- **`command -v uv`**: Checks if `uv` command exists
- **If not found**: Installs `uv` using `$(which python) -m pip install uv`

## **Virtual Environment Check**
- **`$VIRTUAL_ENV`**: Environment variable set when in an active virtual environment
- **If not in venv**: 
  - Creates virtual environment with `uv venv` (creates `.venv/` directory)
  - Activates it with `source .venv/bin/activate`
  - Re-runs the script with `exec "$0" "$@"` to restart in the new environment

## **Key Benefits**
- **`exec`**: Replaces current process instead of creating subprocess
- **`"$@"`**: Passes all original command-line arguments to the re-executed script
- **Self-contained**: Script ensures its own proper environment setup
- **Idempotent**: Won't create multiple venvs if already running in one

The script now automatically handles its own dependency and environment setup before proceeding with the cleanup tasks.
