# Task 1

`imgcolorshine` is a Fire CLI Python tool that:

- takes an --input_image path
- optionally takes an --output_image path (auto-generated if not provided)
- takes a series of "color-attractors". Each attractor is a CSS color specifier (name, #hex value, oklch(), hsl() etc.) followed by a ";" followed by a 0-100 "tolerance" followed by a ";" followed by a 0-100 "strength"
- takes booleans --luminance, --saturation and --hue
- internally operates on the oklch color space
- transform the colors in the image

And here is how it should work:

Imagine that all the colors in the input image are "attractable" to the colors in the provided list of color-attractors.

The tolerance of the attraction defines how dissimilar a color can from be to the attractor to still be attracted by it (the more dissimilar, the weaker the attraction).

The strength of the attraction defines how much the image's colors most similar to a given attractor gets adapted (the more strength, the more the most similar color gets changed, and the dissimilar colors still gets less changes, within tolerance).

(Note: Another way to think of it is that the color attractors are light sources and they shine onto the image, and the gravities are the tolerances of how much of the input image's gets adapted to the color-attractor.)

The booleans --luminance, --saturation and --hue define what aspect of the color gets adapted.

And of course multiple attractors can be provided, then the image's colors are attracted to all of them in some kind of weighted way.

Now: we need to actually reformulate this scientifically. We need to research the science behind it, and we need to write a proper specification.

The spec needs to be written in a way that is easy to understand and easy to use. A senior developer should be able to read it, understand it, and implement the tool based on the spec.

# Proposal by Perplexity

## 1. Overview

The `imgcolorshine` tool implements a physics-inspired color manipulation algorithm that treats color attractors as gravitational sources that influence the colors in an input image[1][2]. This specification provides the mathematical foundation and implementation details for creating a scientifically grounded color transformation system operating in the OKLCH color space[3][4].

## 2. Scientific Foundation

### 2.1. Color Space Theory

The tool operates exclusively in the OKLCH color space, which represents colors using perceptually uniform coordinates[1][5]. OKLCH provides three components that align with human color perception[3][6]:

- **L (Lightness)**: Perceived brightness ranging from 0 (black) to 1 (white)
- **C (Chroma)**: Color intensity or saturation, ranging from 0 (gray) to approximately 0.37 for typical displays
- **H (Hue)**: Color angle in degrees (0-360°), representing the color wheel position

OKLCH offers significant advantages over traditional color spaces like HSL because it maintains perceptual uniformity across different hue angles[6][5]. Unlike HSL, where colors with identical lightness values can appear dramatically different in brightness, OKLCH ensures consistent perceived lightness across all hues[6].

### 2.2. Perceptual Color Distance

Color similarity is measured using the Euclidean distance in OKLCH space[1][7]. The perceptual color difference between two colors C₁(L₁, C₁, H₁) and C₂(L₂, C₂, H₂) is calculated as[8][9]:

```
ΔE = √[(L₂-L₁)² + (C₂-C₁)² + (H₂-H₁)²]
```

This distance metric provides a foundation for determining color attraction relationships, with smaller distances indicating greater perceptual similarity[10][11].

### 2.3. Physics-Based Attraction Model

The color attraction mechanism draws inspiration from gravitational force fields and inverse square law principles[12][13]. Each color attractor functions as a "gravitational source" that exerts influence on nearby colors in the perceptual color space[14][15].

## 3. Mathematical Model

### 3.1. Core Attraction Formula

For each pixel color P(Lₚ, Cₚ, Hₚ) and color attractor A(Lₐ, Cₐ, Hₐ) with tolerance T and strength S, the attraction force is calculated using a modified gravitational model[15][16]:

```
F = S × exp(-d²/T²)
```

Where:

- `F` is the attraction force (0 to 1)
- `S` is the strength parameter (0-100, normalized to 0-1)
- `d` is the perceptual distance between pixel and attractor in OKLCH space
- `T` is the tolerance parameter (0-100, normalized to appropriate scale)

### 3.2. Distance Calculation with Dimensional Weighting

The perceptual distance `d` incorporates selective dimensional processing based on the boolean flags[17][18]:

```
d = √[w_L×(Lₚ-Lₐ)² + w_C×(Cₚ-Cₐ)² + w_H×(Hₚ-Hₐ)²]
```

Where weight factors are determined by the boolean parameters:

- `w_L = 1` if `--luminance` is true, otherwise `w_L = 0`
- `w_C = 1` if `--saturation` is true, otherwise `w_C = 0`
- `w_H = 1` if `--hue` is true, otherwise `w_H = 0`

### 3.3. Multi-Attractor Weighted Blending

When multiple attractors are present, the final color transformation uses weighted interpolation[19][20]:

```
C_final = (Σᵢ Fᵢ × Aᵢ + (1 - Σᵢ Fᵢ) × P) / (1 + Σᵢ Fᵢ - Σᵢ Fᵢ)
```

Where:

- `Fᵢ` is the attraction force from attractor i
- `Aᵢ` is the color of attractor i
- `P` is the original pixel color
- The normalization ensures color values remain within valid bounds

## 4. Algorithm Implementation

### 4.1. Input Processing

1. **Image Loading**: Convert input image to OKLCH color space using standard transformation matrices[21][17]
2. **Attractor Parsing**: Parse CSS color specifications and convert to OKLCH coordinates[22][3]
3. **Parameter Validation**: Ensure tolerance and strength values are within 0-100 range

### 4.2. Core Processing Loop

For each pixel in the input image:

1. **Distance Calculation**: Compute perceptual distance to each attractor using the weighted formula
2. **Force Computation**: Calculate attraction force using the exponential decay function
3. **Tolerance Filtering**: Apply tolerance threshold to determine active attractors
4. **Weighted Blending**: Combine influences from all active attractors
5. **Boundary Checking**: Ensure resulting colors remain within valid OKLCH gamut

### 4.3. Color Space Conversions

The tool requires robust color space conversion routines[21][17]:

```python
def css_to_oklch(css_color):
    """Convert CSS color specification to OKLCH coordinates"""
    # Support for hex, rgb(), hsl(), oklch(), named colors
    pass

def oklch_to_rgb(L, C, H):
    """Convert OKLCH to RGB for output"""
    # Standard OKLCH → RGB transformation
    pass
```

## 5. Technical Specifications

### 5.1. Command Line Interface

```bash
imgcolorshine --input_image  [--output_image ]
               --attractors  [ ...]
               [--luminance] [--saturation] [--hue]
```

### 5.2. Parameter Constraints

- **Tolerance**: 0-100 (maps to perceptual distance units)
- **Strength**: 0-100 (maps to 0.0-1.0 attraction force)
- **Boolean flags**: At least one of `--luminance`, `--saturation`, or `--hue` must be specified

### 5.3. Performance Considerations

The algorithm complexity is O(n×m) where n is the number of pixels and m is the number of attractors[23][24]. For real-time applications, consider implementing spatial optimization techniques or parallel processing for large images[25][18].

### 5.4. Error Handling

1. **Invalid Colors**: Gracefully handle unparseable CSS color specifications
2. **Gamut Limitations**: Implement gamut mapping for out-of-range OKLCH values[4][22]
3. **Numerical Stability**: Prevent division by zero and handle edge cases in color space conversions

## 6. Validation and Testing

### 6.1. Perceptual Validation

The tool's effectiveness should be validated using established color difference metrics[10][11]:

- Delta E measurements for color accuracy
- Visual consistency across different hue ranges
- Preservation of image detail and contrast

### 6.2. Performance Benchmarks

Test the implementation with:

- Various image sizes and formats
- Different numbers of attractors
- Complex color compositions

This specification provides a scientifically grounded foundation for implementing the `imgcolorshine` tool while maintaining computational efficiency and perceptual accuracy[2][3][5].

# Proposal by Phind

I'll develop a comprehensive specification for the `imgcolorshine` tool that transforms images using color attractors in the OKLCH color space. This specification will provide the scientific foundation and implementation details needed for a senior developer to build the tool.

### 6.3. Overview

`imgcolorshine` is a command-line tool that transforms colors in an image by attracting them toward specified color targets. The tool operates in the perceptually uniform OKLCH color space, allowing for intuitive and visually pleasing color transformations.

### 6.4. Scientific Background

OKLCH is a perceptually uniform color space that represents colors using three dimensions:

- **L**: Lightness (0-1)
- **C**: Chroma (0-0.4)
- **H**: Hue (0-360 degrees)

The OKLCH color space offers advantages over RGB and HSL because it's designed to align with human perception, making color transformations more intuitive and predictable.

### 6.5. Color Attraction Model

The core concept of `imgcolorshine` is the "color attractor" which exerts influence on colors in the image based on similarity and specified parameters.

For each pixel in the image:

1. Convert the pixel's color to OKLCH space
2. For each color attractor:
   - Calculate the "similarity" between the pixel color and the attractor color
   - Apply a transformation based on similarity, tolerance, and strength
3. Convert the transformed color back to the original color space

### 6.6. Mathematical Formulation

Let's define the following:

- P = Original pixel color in OKLCH (L₁, C₁, H₁)
- A = Attractor color in OKLCH (L₂, C₂, H₂)
- T = Tolerance (0-100, normalized to 0-1)
- S = Strength (0-100, normalized to 0-1)

#### 6.6.1. Similarity Calculation

The similarity between a pixel color and an attractor is calculated as:

```
distance = √[(L₁-L₂)² + (C₁-C₂)² + 2(C₁·C₂)(1-cos(H₁-H₂))]
similarity = max(0, 1 - (distance / max_distance))
```

Where `max_distance` is scaled by the tolerance parameter T.

#### 6.6.2. Transformation Function

For each component (L, C, H) that is enabled:

```
weight = similarity * S
new_component = original_component + weight * (attractor_component - original_component)
```

When multiple attractors influence a pixel, the weighted average is calculated:

```
final_component = Σ(new_component_i * weight_i) / Σ(weight_i)
```

### 6.7. Command-Line Interface

```
imgcolorshine --input_image <path> [--output_image <path>]
              [--luminance] [--saturation] [--hue]
              <color1>;<tolerance1>;<strength1> [<color2>;<tolerance2>;<strength2> ...]
```

### 6.8. Parameters

1. **--input_image** (required): Path to the input image file
2. **--output_image** (optional): Path for the output image file. If not provided, auto-generated as `input_name_colorshine.ext`
3. **--luminance** (boolean flag): Enable transformation of the lightness component
4. **--saturation** (boolean flag): Enable transformation of the chroma component
5. **--hue** (boolean flag): Enable transformation of the hue component
6. **Color attractors**: One or more color specifications in the format `<color>;<tolerance>;<strength>`
   - `<color>`: CSS color specifier (name, #hex, oklch(), hsl(), etc.)
   - `<tolerance>`: Value from 0-100 indicating how far the influence extends
   - `<strength>`: Value from 0-100 indicating the maximum influence

### 6.9. Algorithm

1. Parse input parameters and color attractors
2. Load the input image
3. Convert image to OKLCH color space
4. For each pixel:
   - Calculate similarity to each attractor
   - Apply weighted transformation based on enabled components
5. Convert back to original color space
6. Save the transformed image

### 6.10. Implementation Notes

1. Use a color library that supports OKLCH conversion (e.g., `colour-science`)
2. Handle edge cases:
   - Colors outside the sRGB gamut
   - Invalid color specifications
   - Zero-weight scenarios
3. Optimize for performance with larger images
4. Provide progress feedback for long-running transformations

### 6.11. Example Usage

```bash
imgcolorshine --input_image photo.jpg --luminance --hue "red;50;75" "oklch(80% 0.2 240);30;50"
```

This command will:

- Load `photo.jpg`
- Transform colors by attracting them toward red (with 50% tolerance and 75% strength) and a blue-ish color in OKLCH
- Only modify the luminance and hue components (not saturation)
- Save the result as `photo_colorshine.jpg`

### 6.12. Error Handling

The tool should provide clear error messages for:

- Invalid input files
- Malformed color specifications
- Invalid parameter values
- Permission issues when writing output

### 6.13. Performance Considerations

For large images, consider:

- Processing in chunks or with parallel execution
- Providing a progress indicator
- Offering a preview mode with downsampled processing

This specification provides the scientific foundation and implementation details needed for a senior developer to build the `imgcolorshine` tool.

# Proposal by Grok

## 7. Overview

`imgcolorshine` is a command-line tool designed to transform the colors of an input image by attracting them toward specified color attractors. Each attractor influences the image’s colors within a defined tolerance and with a specified strength. The tool operates in the OKLCH color space, which consists of Lightness (L), Chroma (C), and Hue (H), ensuring perceptually uniform color adjustments. Users can selectively adjust luminance, saturation (chroma), and hue components via boolean flags.

## 8. Command-Line Arguments

The tool accepts the following arguments:

| Argument | Description | Format |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--input_image` | Path to the input image file. | String (file path) |
| `--output_image` | Optional path to the output image file. If not provided, an auto-generated path (e.g., input path with "\_adjusted" suffix) is used. | String (file path) |
| Color attractors | A series of strings specifying target colors, tolerances, and strengths. | `<color>;<tolerance>;<strength>`, where:<br>- `<color>`: CSS color specifier (e.g., "red", "#FF0000", "oklch(0.7 0.2 40)")<br>- `<tolerance>`: Integer from 0 to 100<br>- `<strength>`: Integer from 0 to 100 |
| `--luminance` | Boolean flag to enable adjustment of the luminance (L) component. | Boolean |
| `--saturation` | Boolean flag to enable adjustment of the saturation (chroma, C) component. | Boolean |
| `--hue` | Boolean flag to enable adjustment of the hue (H) component. | Boolean |

## 9. Color Space

The tool operates in the OKLCH color space, which is derived from the Oklab color space for perceptual uniformity. OKLCH components are:

- **L (Lightness)**: Ranges from 0 (black) to 1 (white).
- **C (Chroma)**: Ranges from 0 (neutral) to approximately 0.37 (maximum within sRGB gamut).
- **H (Hue)**: Ranges from 0 to 360 degrees, representing the color angle.

Distances are computed in Oklab space (L, a, b coordinates) to ensure accurate perceptual differences, as Oklab is designed such that Euclidean distances approximate perceptual color differences (e.g., a distance of 0.01 in Oklab corresponds roughly to a Delta E of 1).

## 10. Algorithm

The color transformation process is as follows:

1. **Input Parsing:**

   - Read the input image, assumed to be in sRGB color space.
   - Parse each color attractor string to extract:
     - The color, converted to OKLCH coordinates \( (L_a, C_a, H_a) \) using a library like [colormath](https://python-colormath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or equivalent.
     - Tolerance \( t_a \) (0–100).
     - Strength \( s_a \) (0–100).
   - Read the boolean flags to determine which components (L, C, H) to adjust.

2. **Color Transformation:**

   - For each pixel in the image: a. Convert the pixel’s color from sRGB to OKLCH: \( (L*p, C_p, H_p) \). b. Initialize adjustment accumulators: \( \Delta L = 0 \), \( \Delta C = 0 \), \( \Delta H = 0 \). c. For each attractor \( a \) with OKLCH coordinates \( (L_a, C_a, H_a) \), tolerance \( t_a \), and strength \( s_a \): i. Convert the pixel’s and attractor’s OKLCH coordinates to Oklab: - Pixel: \( a_p = C_p \times \cos(H_p \times \frac{\pi}{180}) \), \( b_p = C_p \times \sin(H_p \times \frac{\pi}{180}) \), yielding \( (L_p, a_p, b_p) \). - Attractor: \( a_a = C_a \times \cos(H_a \times \frac{\pi}{180}) \), \( b_a = C_a \times \sin(H_a \times \frac{\pi}{180}) \), yielding \( (L_a, a_a, b_a) \). ii. Compute the Euclidean distance in Oklab space: \[ d = \sqrt{(L_p - L_a)^2 + (a_p - a_a)^2 + (b_p - b_a)^2} \] iii. Calculate the maximum distance threshold: \[ d*{\text{max}} = \frac{t*a}{100} \times 1.0 \] where 1.0 is the reference distance in Oklab space, covering most color differences within the sRGB gamut. iv. Compute the attraction weight: \[ w_a = \max\left(0, 1 - \frac{d}{d*{\text{max}}}\right) \] This ensures that colors beyond \( d\_{\text{max}} \) are unaffected, and the influence decreases linearly as distance increases. v. Apply adjustments based on enabled flags: - If `--luminance` is enabled: \[ \Delta L += w_a \times \frac{s_a}{100} \times (L_a - L_p) \] - If `--saturation` is enabled: \[ \Delta C += w_a \times \frac{s_a}{100} \times (C_a - C_p) \] - If `--hue` is enabled: - Compute the angular difference: \[ \delta H = \text{atan2}\left(\sin((H_a - H_p) \times \frac{\pi}{180}), \cos((H_a - H_p) \times \frac{\pi}{180})\right) \times \frac{180}{\pi} \] - Accumulate: \[ \Delta H += w_a \times \frac{s_a}{100} \times \delta H \] d. Compute the adjusted color components:
     - \( L_p' = L_p + \Delta L \)
     - \( C_p' = C_p + \Delta C \)
     - \( H_p' = (H_p + \Delta H) \mod 360 \) e. Convert the adjusted OKLCH color \( (L_p', C_p', H_p') \) back to sRGB, clipping or projecting to the sRGB gamut if necessary to handle out-of-gamut colors.

3. **Output:**
   - Save the transformed image to the specified or auto-generated output path.

## 11. Example

Consider an image with various colors and two attractors:

- "red;50;80" (parsed as OKLCH \( (0.627, 0.257, 40) \), \( t_a = 50 \), \( s_a = 80 \))
- "blue;50;80" (parsed as OKLCH \( (0.453, 0.150, 264) \), \( t_a = 50 \), \( s_a = 80 \))

With all flags (`--luminance`, `--saturation`, `--hue`) enabled:

- For a pixel close to red, the distance to the red attractor is small, yielding a high \( w_a \), so it is strongly adjusted toward red’s OKLCH values.
- For a pixel close to blue, it is strongly adjusted toward blue.
- For a pixel midway between, both attractors contribute, with weights based on their distances, resulting in a blended adjustment.

## 12. Notes

- **Reference Distance**: The tolerance is scaled with a reference distance of 1.0 in Oklab space, which approximates the maximum color difference within the sRGB gamut (e.g., black to white has a distance of ~1.0).
- **Hue Handling**: Hue adjustments use the shortest angular difference to ensure natural transitions (e.g., from 350° to 10° goes through 0°, not 360°).
- **Gamut Clipping**: When converting back to sRGB, out-of-gamut colors are clipped or projected to the gamut boundary, which may slightly alter the perceived color.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If \( t*a = 0 \), \( d*{\text{max}} = 0 \), so only exact matches (rare due to floating-point precision) are affected, effectively nullifying the attractor’s influence.
  - If \( s_a = 0 \), the attractor contributes no adjustment.
  - If no attractors are provided, the image remains unchanged.
- **Performance**: For efficiency, implementations should use vectorized operations (e.g., via [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) or [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)) to process pixels in bulk.
- **Color Conversion**: Libraries like [colormath](https://python-colormath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [colour-science](https://www.colour-science.org/) can handle conversions between sRGB, OKLCH, and Oklab accurately.

This specification provides a clear, mathematically grounded framework for implementing `imgcolorshine`, enabling precise and perceptually meaningful color transformations based on user-specified attractors.

## 13. 1\. Theoretical Foundations in Perceptual Color Science

The capacity to manipulate the colors of a digital image in a manner that is both predictable and aesthetically pleasing is contingent upon the selection of an appropriate mathematical framework for representing color. The intuitive concepts of "color similarity" and "strength of attraction" are not abstract artistic notions; they are quantifiable properties that can only be modeled effectively within a color space that aligns with the mechanics of human vision. This section establishes the scientific principles that underpin the entire transformation algorithm, beginning with an analysis of legacy color models, justifying the selection of the OKLCH color space, and culminating in a precise mathematical definition of perceptual color difference.

### 13.1. 1.1 The Imperative for Perceptual Uniformity: Limitations of Legacy Color

Models

Traditional digital color models, such as RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness), while ubiquitous, are fundamentally unsuitable for sophisticated perceptual manipulation. Their design prioritizes hardware convenience and simple geometric representation over alignment with human visual perception.

The RGB model, often represented via hexadecimal codes (e.g., `#FF0000`), directly maps to the intensities of red, green, and blue phosphors or LEDs in a display device. While this is efficient for rendering, it is profoundly unintuitive for an artist or designer. Modifying a color to be "slightly lighter" or "more vivid" requires non-obvious adjustments to three interdependent values. More critically, the perceptual distance between colors is not correlated with their numerical distance in RGB space. For example, the Euclidean distance between two pairs of RGB values can be identical, yet one pair may appear nearly indistinguishable to the human eye while the other appears dramatically different. This non-uniformity makes it impossible to define a consistent "tolerance" for color attraction.

The HSL model was developed as a more human-friendly alternative, arranging colors in a cylinder with dimensions of Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. While conceptually more intuitive, HSL suffers from a severe and well-documented lack of perceptual uniformity. The primary flaw lies in its Lightness (L) component. In HSL, a pure yellow (

`hsl(60, 100%, 50%)`) and a pure blue (`hsl(240, 100%, 50%)`) share the same lightness value of 50%, yet the yellow appears significantly brighter to the human eye than the blue. This discrepancy means that adjusting the 'L' value does not produce a predictable change in perceived brightness across different hues. Consequently, creating a color palette by holding S and L constant while varying H results in a set of colors with inconsistent perceived brightness. Furthermore, creating gradients between colors in HSL space often produces undesirable "gray dead zones" where the transition path passes through a region of low saturation, a direct artifact of its non-uniform geometry.

For a tool like `imgcolorshine`, which depends on a reliable, quantifiable measure of color dissimilarity to define the "tolerance" of an attraction, these legacy models are untenable. A fixed numerical tolerance in HSL or RGB space would have a wildly unpredictable perceptual effect depending on the region of the color space being operated on. A new foundation is required—one built from the ground up to model human perception.

### 13.2. 1.2 The OKLCH Color Space: A Model Aligned with Human Vision

To overcome the limitations of legacy models, this specification mandates the use of the **OKLCH color space** for all internal color computations. OKLCH is the cylindrical representation of the Oklab color space, which was proposed by Björn Ottosson in 2020 as a modern, perceptually uniform model designed to predict lightness, chroma, and hue in a way that closely mimics human vision. It represents a significant improvement over older "uniform" spaces like CIELAB, particularly in its handling of blue hues and its overall hue linearity.

The OKLCH model defines colors using three intuitive and largely independent components :

- **L (Lightness):** Represents the _perceived lightness_ of a color. It is specified as a value from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%), where 0 corresponds to pure black and 1 corresponds to pure white. Crucially, unlike HSL's lightness, a given L value in OKLCH corresponds to the same level of perceived brightness regardless of the hue or chroma. This property is the cornerstone of predictable color manipulation.

- **C (Chroma):** Represents the "amount of color" or vividness, analogous to saturation. It ranges from 0 for a neutral gray to a theoretical maximum that is unbounded but in practice depends on the color gamut and the specific hue. For colors within the common sRGB and Display P3 gamuts, chroma values rarely exceed 0.4. Different hues have different maximum possible chroma values at a given lightness; for instance, it is possible to have much more chromatic yellows than blues at high lightness levels.

- **H (Hue):** Represents the color's angle on a color wheel, ranging from 0 to 360 degrees. The hue circle progresses through reds (around 20-40°), yellows (around 90°), greens (around 140°), blues (around 260°), and back to red. As an angle, it is cyclical, with 360° being equivalent to 0°.

The fundamental advantage of OKLCH is its **perceptual uniformity**. This means that a change of a given numerical amount in any of its L, C, or H components results in a correspondingly consistent and predictable _perceptual_ change to the color. This property is not an accident; the Oklab space was mathematically constructed using modern color appearance models (CAM16) and datasets to achieve this goal. This uniformity makes color modifications intuitive, reliable, and mathematically sound. It enables the creation of smooth, even gradients without gray dead zones and allows for the development of design systems where color variations (like hover states or disabled states) can be generated algorithmically with predictable results.

By adopting OKLCH, the `imgcolorshine` tool can operate on a system where the intuitive user concepts of "tolerance" and "strength" can be mapped directly to meaningful, quantifiable geometric operations.

### 13.3. 1.3 Quantifying Perceptual Similarity: Color Difference (ΔE) in Oklab

With a perceptually uniform color space established, it becomes possible to define a meaningful metric for color difference, or dissimilarity. The user's concept of "tolerance" requires a way to measure how "far apart" two colors are, not in a purely numerical sense, but in a way that reflects what a human observer would perceive.

In non-uniform spaces like sRGB, the simple Euclidean distance formula (`sqrt(ΔR² + ΔG² + ΔB²)`) is a poor indicator of perceptual difference. However, the defining characteristic of a perceptually uniform space like Oklab is that Euclidean distance

_does_ correlate strongly with perceived difference. Therefore, this specification adopts the Euclidean distance in the Cartesian

**Oklab** space as the fundamental metric for color difference. This metric is often denoted as **ΔEok** (Delta E Oklab).

The calculation of ΔEok between two colors, `Color₁` and `Color₂`, proceeds as follows:

1. **Convert from OKLCH to Oklab:** Both colors must first be represented in the Cartesian Oklab coordinate system. The Oklab space shares the same Lightness (L) axis as OKLCH but replaces the polar coordinates of Chroma (C) and Hue (h) with two opponent-color axes, `a` (green-red) and `b` (blue-yellow). The conversion is a standard polar-to-Cartesian transformation:

   - L1​,a1​,b1​ from L1​,C1​,h1​

   - a1​=C1​⋅cos(h1​)

   - b1​=C1​⋅sin(h1​)

   - L2​,a2​,b2​ from L2​,C2​,h2​

   - a2​=C2​⋅cos(h2​)

   - b2​=C2​⋅sin(h2​) _(Note: The hue angle`h` must be in radians for trigonometric functions.)_

2. **Calculate Euclidean Distance:** The perceptual difference, ΔEok, is the standard Euclidean distance between the two points `(L₁, a₁, b₁)` and `(L₂, a₂, b₂)` in this 3D space.

ΔEok​=(L1​−L2​)2+(a1​−a2​)2+(b1​−b2​)2![](data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg

This approach provides a computationally efficient and perceptually meaningful metric that will serve as the mathematical basis for the `tolerance` parameter. It is important to distinguish this from more complex, and computationally expensive, color difference formulas like CIEDE2000. CIEDE2000 was developed to correct for known non-uniformities in the older CIELAB space, particularly in the blue regions. While Oklab itself was designed to fix these same issues, making a simple Euclidean distance calculation highly effective, CIEDE2000 remains a benchmark for perceptual accuracy. For the purposes of this tool, the simplicity and speed of ΔEok make it the ideal choice, providing an excellent balance of performance and perceptual fidelity. The ability to use this simple formula is a direct and powerful consequence of choosing to operate within the Oklab/OKLCH color space.

## 14. 2\. The Single-Attractor Transformation Model

This section deconstructs the behavior of a single color attractor, providing a formal mathematical model for its influence on an individual pixel in the source image. The model translates the user's intuitive parameters—`color- attractor`, `tolerance`, and `strength`—into a precise, step-by-step algorithm.

### 14.1. 2.1 Formalizing the Attractor Primitive

The fundamental unit of transformation is the **color attractor**. It is defined by a user-provided string with three components, separated by semicolons.

**Syntax:** `color_spec;tolerance;strength`

- **`color_spec`** : A string specifying the attractor's color. This string must be parsable as a standard CSS `<color>` value, providing maximum flexibility for the user. This includes, but is not limited to, named colors (e.g., `red`, `blue`), hexadecimal codes (e.g., `#ff0000`, `#00f`), and functional notations (e.g., `rgb(255, 0, 0)`, `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)`, `oklch(62.8% 0.25 29.2)`). Internally, any valid

`color_spec` will be immediately converted into its OKLCH representation, which we will denote as Cattr​=(Lattr​,Cattr​,hattr​).

- **`tolerance`** : An integer value in the range . This parameter controls the "reach" or "radius of influence" of the attractor in the perceptual color space. A value of 0 indicates the attractor only affects colors identical to it, while 100 indicates the maximum possible reach.

- **`strength`** : An integer value in the range . This parameter governs the magnitude of the color transformation for pixels that fall within the attractor's tolerance field. A value of 0 means no change will occur, while 100 indicates the maximum possible "pull" towards the attractor's color.

For each pixel in the source image, its color, Psrc​=(Lsrc​,Csrc​,hsrc​), will be evaluated against this attractor primitive to determine the resulting transformed color.

### 14.2. 2.2 The Tolerance Field: Mapping Tolerance to a Perceptual Radius

The user-facing `tolerance` parameter (0-100) must be mapped to a concrete, scientifically meaningful value. This value is the maximum perceptual color difference, which we will call ΔEmax​, that defines the boundary of the attractor's influence. Any source pixel whose color difference from the attractor, ΔEok​(Psrc​,Cattr​), is greater than ΔEmax​ will be completely unaffected by this attractor. This effectively creates a spherical volume of influence around the attractor's color in the 3D Oklab space.

A simple linear mapping from `tolerance` to ΔEmax​ is possible, but a non- linear mapping provides more intuitive control. Human perception is more sensitive to small color differences than large ones. Therefore, an exponential mapping function allows the user to have finer control at lower `tolerance` values, where subtle adjustments are most critical.

The proposed mapping function is:

ΔEmax​=k⋅(100tolerance​)p

Where:

- `tolerance` is the user-provided integer from 0 to 100.

- k is a scaling factor that defines the maximum possible ΔE value. A value of k=150 is recommended, as this covers a very wide range of perceptual differences.

- p is an exponent that shapes the curve. A value of p=2 (a quadratic curve) is recommended to provide sensitive control at low tolerance settings while still allowing for a wide range at high settings.

To make this abstract mapping comprehensible to the end-user, documentation should include a table that translates the numerical `tolerance` input into a qualitative perceptual interpretation. This is essential for usability, as users cannot be expected to have an intuitive feel for ΔE units. A Just- Noticeable-Difference (JND) is typically considered to be around ΔE≈2.3.

**Table 1: Tolerance Parameter Mapping and Perceptual Interpretation**

| `tolerance` (0-100) | Mapped ΔEmax​ (approx.) | Perceptual Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | **No Tolerance:** Affects only exact color matches. |
| 10 | 1.5 | **Micro Tolerance:** Affects only nearly indistinguishable colors. |
| 25 | 9.4 | **Low Tolerance:** Affects perceptually similar shades and tints. |
| 50 | 37.5 | **Medium Tolerance:** Affects analogous colors (e.g., different |

shades of blue).  
75| 84.4| **High Tolerance:** Affects a broad range of related colors (e.g., blues and purples).  
100| 150| **Maximum Tolerance:** Affects a vast range of even highly dissimilar colors.

### 14.3. 2.3 The Attraction Falloff Curve: From Distance to Influence

Within the tolerance field (i.e., for pixels where ΔEok​≤ΔEmax​), the influence of the attractor should not be uniform. The user's description implies that the attraction is weaker for more dissimilar colors. This suggests a falloff effect, where the influence diminishes as a pixel's color approaches the edge of the tolerance sphere.

To model this, we first calculate a **normalized distance** , dnorm​, for the pixel's color within the attractor's field of influence:

dnorm​=ΔEmax​ΔEok​(Psrc​,Cattr​)​

This value, dnorm​, will range from 0 (for a pixel color identical to the attractor) to 1 (for a pixel color at the very edge of the tolerance boundary).

A simple linear falloff, where influence is `1 - d_norm`, would produce a harsh, mechanical-looking transition. To achieve a more natural and aesthetically pleasing effect, we borrow a concept from animation and user interface design: **easing functions**. These are non-linear functions that describe a rate of change, perfect for modeling a smooth decay of influence.

An **ease-out** curve is the ideal model here. It ensures that colors very close to the attractor are strongly affected, with the influence decreasing slowly at first and then more rapidly as the color approaches the tolerance boundary. We define an **`attraction_factor`** (ranging from 0 to 1) using a standard cubic Bézier easing function. The `attraction_factor` is a function of the pixel's proximity, which can be expressed as `1 - d_norm`.

Let t=1−dnorm​. The `attraction_factor` is calculated using a cubic Bézier curve, B(t). A standard `ease-out` curve, equivalent to `cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1)`, can be implemented with the polynomial:

$$\text{attraction_factor} = B(t) = (1 - (1-t)^3) \cdot 0.58 + t^3 \cdot 1$$

This formula is an approximation, but a simple polynomial like t2 or t3 can also serve as an effective ease-out function, providing a smoother falloff than a linear one. The use of such a curve is a key refinement that elevates the algorithm's output quality from purely mechanical to perceptually smooth.

### 14.4. 2.4 The Strength Parameter and Final Transformation via Interpolation

The final step is to compute the transformed color, Pfinal​. This is accomplished by pulling the source pixel's color, Psrc​, towards the attractor's color, Cattr​. The amount of this "pull" is determined by the combination of the user's `strength` parameter and the calculated `attraction_factor`.

We define an **interpolation amount** , tinterp​, which represents the total influence on the pixel:

$$
t_{interp} = \left( \frac{\text{strength}}{100} \right) \cdot
\text{attraction_factor}
$$

This value, tinterp​, will be in the range . It is 0 if the pixel is outside the tolerance range, and it scales up to a maximum of `strength / 100` for a pixel color that is identical to the attractor.

The final color, Pfinal​, is then calculated via **linear interpolation (lerp)** between the source color and the attractor color in OKLCH space.

Pfinal​=lerp(Psrc​,Cattr​,tinterp​)

This interpolation must be performed component-wise for the L, C, and H channels. The formula for a single component (e.g., Lightness) is:

Lfinal​=Lsrc​⋅(1−tinterp​)+Lattr​⋅tinterp​

The same linear interpolation is applied to the Chroma (C) component. For the Hue (H) component, which is circular, the interpolation must take the shortest path around the color wheel. For example, interpolating from 350° to 10° should pass through 0°, not travel all the way around through 180°. This is a standard feature in robust color interpolation libraries.

This model elegantly decomposes the user's abstract concepts into a clear, multi-stage process: a `tolerance` parameter defines a perceptual field, a distance-based easing function determines a falloff `attraction_factor` within that field, and a `strength` parameter scales this factor to control the final interpolation, resulting in a predictable and smooth color transformation.

## 15. 3\. The Multi-Attractor Interaction Model

When an image is subjected to the influence of multiple color attractors simultaneously, a method is required to resolve their competing effects on each pixel. A simple sequential application of each attractor's transformation would produce order-dependent and unpredictable results. Instead, the influences must be calculated in parallel and combined in a principled, weighted manner. This section specifies a model based on the concept of superposition, using Inverse Distance Weighting to calculate a final, blended transformation.

### 15.1. 3.1 The Principle of Superposition and Weighted Averaging

The core principle for combining multiple influences is that of superposition. For any given pixel in the source image, Psrc​, its final transformed color, Pfinal​, will be a **weighted average** of the outcomes proposed by each individual attractor that has influence over it.

The process for a single pixel is as follows:

1. **Evaluate Each Attractor:** For each attractor i in the user-provided list, calculate its proposed final color for Psrc​. This involves applying the full single-attractor model described in Section 2.

   - First, determine if Psrc​ is within the tolerance field of attractor i by checking if ΔEok​(Psrc​,Cattri​​)≤ΔEmaxi​​.

   - If it is, calculate the proposed final color, Pfinali​​, via interpolation as specified in Section 2.4.

   - If it is not, attractor i has no influence on this pixel.

2. **Calculate Weights:** For every attractor i that influences the pixel, calculate a weight, wi​, that quantifies its degree of influence relative to the other active attractors. The methodology for this is detailed in Section 3.2.

3. **Compute Weighted Average:** The final color, Pfinal​, is the weighted average of all proposed colors, Pfinal1​​,Pfinal2​​,...,Pfinaln​​, using their corresponding weights, w1​,w2​,...,wn​.

Pfinal​=∑i=1n​wi​∑i=1n​(wi​⋅Pfinali​​)​

This averaging must be performed component-wise for each of the L, C, and H channels. A crucial detail is the handling of the Hue (H) channel, which is circular. A simple arithmetic mean is incorrect for angular data. For example, the average of 350° and 10° should be 0° (or 360°), not 180°. Therefore, a **weighted circular mean** must be used for the Hue channel.

This approach ensures that the final color is a smooth blend of the influences, with attractors that are "closer" in color space contributing more significantly to the final result.

### 15.2. 3.2 Formalizing Influence with Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)

To formalize the weighting scheme, this specification adopts the **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)** algorithm. IDW is a standard, deterministic method for multivariate interpolation that is widely used in fields like geostatistics. Its fundamental assumption is that the influence of a known point diminishes with distance, which perfectly models the user's "color shining" analogy: light sources that are closer (more similar in color) have a stronger effect.

The weight, wi​, for each influential attractor i on a source pixel Psrc​ is calculated as the inverse of its perceptual distance, raised to a power parameter, p.

wi​=(ΔEok​(Psrc​,Cattri​​))p1​

Where:

- ΔEok​(Psrc​,Cattri​​) is the perceptual color difference between the source pixel and the attractor, as defined in Section 1.3.

- p is the **power parameter** , a positive real number that controls the rate at which influence falls off with distance.

A special case must be handled: if ΔEok​=0 (the pixel color is identical to the attractor color), the weight would be infinite. In this scenario, the weight wi​ should be considered overwhelmingly large, effectively making the final color equal to the attractor's color, or the transformation can be short-circuited to immediately return Pfinali​​.

The choice of the power parameter p has significant artistic implications:

- **p =1 (Inverse Distance):** Provides a gradual, linear falloff of influence.

- **p =2 (Inverse Distance Squared):** This is a common default value. It gives much stronger preference to the nearest attractors, causing influence to drop off rapidly with distance. This results in sharper transitions between the zones of influence of different attractors.

- **Higher p values:** As p increases, the influence of the single closest attractor becomes completely dominant. The resulting image will resemble a Voronoi diagram in color space, with hard-edged regions of color corresponding to the nearest attractor.

For `imgcolorshine`, a default power of **p =2** is recommended. However, exposing this as an advanced command-line argument (e.g., `--idw-power`) would provide a powerful, albeit non-obvious, control for users to adjust the "hardness" or "softness" of the color blending.

### 15.3. 3.3 Selective Channel Application (`--luminance`, `--saturation`, `--hue`)

The user query specifies boolean flags (`--luminance`, `--saturation`, `--hue`) to constrain the transformation to specific aspects of the color. It is critical to understand that this is not a post-processing step but an integral modification to the core interpolation and averaging algorithms. The "saturation" flag will be interpreted as controlling the Chroma (C) component of OKLCH.

When one or more of these flags are active, the transformation logic is modified at two key points:

1. **During Single-Attractor Interpolation:** In the calculation of the proposed final color, Pfinali​​, the `lerp` function (Section 2.4) is only applied to the components corresponding to the active flags. For any inactive channel, its value is simply copied from the source pixel, Psrc​.

For example, if only `--luminance` is active, the calculation for Pfinali​​ becomes:

     * Lfinali​​=lerp(Lsrc​,Lattri​​,tinterpi​​)

     * Cfinali​​=Csrc​

     * hfinali​​=hsrc​

2. **During Multi-Attractor Weighted Averaging:** The weighted average calculation (Section 3.1) is also performed only on the active channels. For any inactive channel, the final value is again copied directly from the source pixel, Psrc​.

Continuing the example where only `--luminance` is active, the final pixel color Pfinal​ is computed as:

     * Lfinal​=∑i=1n​wi​∑i=1n​(wi​⋅Lfinali​​)​

     * Cfinal​=Csrc​

     * hfinal​=hsrc​

If no flags are provided, the default behavior is to assume all three (`--luminance`, `--saturation`, `--hue`) are active, resulting in a full color transformation. This component-wise control is a natural capability of the OKLCH color space, where the L, C, and H channels are designed to be perceptually independent, allowing for modifications to one channel without unintended shifts in the others. This mirrors the functionality seen in modern CSS relative color syntax, which leverages the same properties of OKLCH for predictable modifications.

## 16. 4\. Implementation Specification and Algorithmic Details

This section provides a comprehensive and unambiguous blueprint for the implementation of the `imgcolorshine` tool. It translates the preceding theoretical models into a concrete, step-by-step process, complete with pseudocode, and addresses critical practical considerations such as color space management and parameter parsing.

### 16.1. 4.1 End-to-End Processing Pipeline

The execution of the `imgcolorshine` tool follows a well-defined pipeline, from command-line invocation to final image output. This sequence ensures colorimetrically correct operations at every stage.

1. **Argument Parsing:** The command-line interface (CLI) parser shall ingest all user-provided arguments: `--input_image`, `--output_image` (optional), the list of `color-attractor` strings, and the boolean flags (`--luminance`, `--saturation`, `--hue`).

2. **Attractor Initialization:** Each `color-attractor` string must be validated and parsed. The `color_spec` part is converted from its CSS format into an internal OKLCH representation. The `tolerance` and `strength` values are stored. This creates a list of attractor objects, each containing its color Cattr​, tolerance, and strength.

3. **Image Loading:** The input image specified by `--input_image` is loaded into a memory buffer. The image data is assumed to be in the standard sRGB color space.

4. **Gamma Decoding (sRGB to Linear sRGB):** This is a critical step. Standard sRGB images are gamma-encoded. All mathematical operations, including color space conversions and interpolations, must be performed in a linear color space to be physically and perceptually correct. Each R, G, and B channel value (typically in the range ) must be normalized to and then passed through a gamma decoding function to convert it to a linear intensity value.

5. **Color Space Conversion (Linear sRGB to Oklab):** The buffer of linear sRGB pixel data is converted into the Oklab color space. This involves a series of matrix multiplications and a cube-root non-linearity as defined by Ottosson. Storing the colors in their Cartesian Oklab form

`(L, a, b)` is most efficient for the repeated distance calculations.

6. **Output Buffer Allocation:** A new, empty buffer of the same dimensions as the input image is created to store the transformed pixel data in OKLCH format.

7. **Per-Pixel Transformation Loop:** The core of the algorithm iterates through each pixel of the Oklab image buffer. For each source pixel, Psrc​: a. The multi-attractor transformation algorithm, as detailed in Section 3, is executed. This involves calculating the influence and proposed transformation from every relevant attractor. b. The final weighted average color is computed. c. The resulting color, which may be in Oklab for averaging, is converted to OKLCH and stored in the corresponding position in the output buffer.

8. **Color Space Conversion (OKLCH to Linear sRGB):** The completed OKLCH output buffer is converted back to the linear sRGB color space. This is the inverse of the transformation in step 5.

9. **Gamut Clipping:** The transformation process can produce colors that are outside the destination sRGB gamut (i.e., resulting in R, G, or B values less than 0 or greater than 1). These out-of-gamut colors must be brought back into gamut. A perceptually superior method to simple RGB clamping is to perform clipping in OKLCH space: for an out-of-gamut color, its Lightness (L) and Hue (h) are preserved while its Chroma (C) is progressively reduced until the color fits within the sRGB gamut.

10. **Gamma Encoding (Linear sRGB to sRGB):** The gamut-clipped, linear sRGB pixel data is passed through a gamma encoding function to convert it back to the standard, non-linear sRGB representation suitable for display and storage.

11. **Image Saving:** The final sRGB data is saved to the file specified by `--output_image`. If no path was provided, a new path should be auto-generated based on the input file name.

### 16.2. 4.2 Pseudocode Implementation

The following pseudocode provides a detailed, language-agnostic implementation of the core transformation logic.

### 16.3. 4.3 Color Space Conversion and Gamut Handling

Robust and accurate color space conversion is non-negotiable for the integrity of the algorithm. Implementation should rely on well-tested color science libraries or implement the standard formulas precisely.

- **sRGB ↔ Linear sRGB:** The standard sRGB transfer functions must be used.

  - **Decoding (sRGB to Linear):** For a normalized channel value Csrgb​: $$ C*{linear} = \begin{cases} C*{srgb} / 12.92 & \text{if } C*{srgb} \le 0.04045 \ \left( \frac{C*{srgb} + 0.055}{1.055} \right)^{2.4} & \text{if } C\_{srgb} > 0.04045 \end{cases} $$

  - **Encoding (Linear to sRGB):** For a linear channel value Clinear​: $$ C*{srgb} = \begin{cases} C*{linear} \cdot 12.92 & \text{if } C*{linear} \le 0.0031308 \ 1.055 \cdot C*{linear}^{(1/2.4)} - 0.055 & \text{if } C\_{linear} > 0.0031308 \end{cases} $$

- **Linear sRGB ↔ Oklab:** This conversion follows the process defined by Ottosson, which involves an intermediate conversion to a cone-like space (LMS) and then to Oklab via matrix transformations. These transformations are well-documented and should be implemented as specified in the original Oklab paper.

- **Gamut Clipping:** As noted, the recommended gamut clipping method involves reducing a color's Chroma in OKLCH space until it fits into the target sRGB gamut. A practical implementation can use a binary search approach for efficiency: if a color is out of gamut, halve its Chroma and check again. If it's now in gamut, try increasing Chroma by half the previous step. Repeat this process for a fixed number of iterations to quickly converge on the maximum possible Chroma that is still within the sRGB gamut, while preserving the original Lightness and Hue.

### 16.4. 4.4 Parameter Parsing and Validation

A robust command-line interface is crucial for usability.

- **Color Parsing:** The implementation should leverage a comprehensive color parsing library capable of handling the full gamut of CSS color specifications. This relieves the tool of needing to implement its own complex color string parser.

- **Attractor String Parsing:** The logic to split the `color;tolerance;strength` string must be robust. It should handle potential whitespace and provide clear error messages for malformed strings, such as missing components or non-numeric values for tolerance and strength.

- **Variable Glossary:** Clear documentation is key. A glossary of all internal variables and parameters should be maintained.

**Table 3: Key Algorithm Parameters and Variables**

| Variable | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Psrc​ | OKLCH Color | The color of the source pixel being processed. |
| Cattr​ | OKLCH Color | The color of a given attractor. |

## 17. 5\. Recommendations and Potential Extensions

The specification outlined in the preceding sections provides a robust and scientifically grounded foundation for the `imgcolorshine` tool. Looking forward, this foundation can be extended in several powerful directions, transforming the tool from a novel filter into a versatile platform for professional-grade color manipulation. This section discusses performance optimization strategies and outlines several promising avenues for future development.

### 17.1. 5.1 Performance Optimization Strategies

The per-pixel nature of the specified algorithm, while conceptually clear, can be computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution images and a large number of attractors. Several strategies can be employed to mitigate this and achieve interactive or near-real-time performance.

- **Parallelization:** The core transformation loop is "embarrassingly parallel," meaning the calculation for each pixel is independent of all others. The workload can be trivially distributed across multiple CPU cores using standard multithreading or multiprocessing libraries. This can lead to a near-linear performance increase with the number of available cores.

- **GPU Acceleration:** For a significant leap in performance, the entire algorithm is exceptionally well-suited for implementation on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The necessary operations—color space conversions (which are matrix multiplications), distance calculations, interpolations, and weighted averages—are all fundamental primitives in GPU programming, often implemented in shader languages like GLSL or HLSL. Porting the per-pixel logic to a GPU fragment shader would enable the processing of millions of pixels in parallel, likely achieving real-time performance even for large images.

- **Look-Up Table (LUT) Pre-calculation:** For use cases where the set of attractors is fixed, the entire color transformation can be pre-calculated and baked into a 3D Look-Up Table (LUT). A 3D LUT is essentially a cube in a color space (e.g., RGB) where each point stores the corresponding output color. To generate the LUT, one would iterate through a grid of input colors (e.g., a 33x33x33 grid in RGB space), apply the full `imgcolorshine` transformation to each grid point, and store the result. To process an image, the color of each pixel is used to look up the corresponding transformed color in the 3D LUT, with trilinear interpolation used for input colors that fall between the grid points. This reduces the complex per-pixel calculation to a simple, extremely fast memory lookup, at the cost of a one-time pre-calculation step.

### 17.2. 5.2 Future Work: Advanced Transformation Models

The current model operates exclusively in the 3D domain of color space. By introducing new dimensions and more sophisticated mathematical models, the tool's capabilities can be dramatically expanded.

- **Spatial Influence with Radial Basis Functions (RBFs):** The most powerful extension would be to incorporate spatial location into the attraction model. This would allow an attractor to be defined not just by a color, but by a color and an `(x, y)` coordinate on the image. A pixel's transformation would then depend on both its color similarity _and_ its spatial proximity to the attractor. This transforms the problem from a 3D interpolation in color space to a 5D interpolation in `(L, a, b, x, y)` space. For this type of scattered, high-dimensional data interpolation, **Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)** are the ideal mathematical tool. An RBF-based model would define an influence that radiates outwards from the attractor's location in both color and spatial dimensions, allowing for true "light shining" effects, localized color grading, and complex, organic transformations that are currently only achievable through manual masking.

- **Alternative Color Difference Metrics (CIEDE2000):** While ΔEok provides an excellent balance of performance and accuracy, it is not the final word in perceptual color difference. The **CIEDE2000** formula is the industry standard for applications requiring the highest possible fidelity to human perception, such as in the textile and print industries. It introduces complex weighting functions to correct for the known idiosyncrasies of human vision, particularly in how we perceive differences in lightness, chroma, and hue in different regions of the color space. A future version of

`imgcolorshine` could offer CIEDE2000 as an optional, high-quality mode for calculating color difference. This would replace the `calculate_delta_e_ok` function with a CIEDE2000 implementation. The trade-off would be a significant increase in computational cost for a marginal (but potentially critical for some users) increase in perceptual accuracy.

- **Palette-Based Attraction and Color Transfer:** The concept of attractors can be generalized from single colors to entire color palettes. An advanced feature could allow a user to provide a second, "reference" image instead of a list of color attractors. The tool would first perform palette extraction on the reference image, using a clustering algorithm like k-means or median-cut in Oklab space to identify a set of dominant, representative colors. This extracted palette would then be used as the set of color attractors for the source image. This extension would effectively transform

`imgcolorshine` into a sophisticated **color transfer** tool, capable of imbuing a source image with the complete color mood and character of a reference image, but in a way that is guided by the perceptual attraction model rather than simple statistical matching.

These potential extensions demonstrate that the `imgcolorshine` concept is not merely a filter but a specific application of broader principles in computational geometry and color science. Recognizing this connection provides a clear and ambitious roadmap for future development, with the potential to create a uniquely powerful tool for creative and technical image manipulation.

## 18. Conclusion

This document has provided a comprehensive scientific and technical specification for the `imgcolorshine` color transformation tool. By grounding the user's intuitive concepts of "attraction," "tolerance," and "strength" in the principles of modern perceptual color science, we have translated an abstract idea into a concrete, implementable algorithm.

The foundational choice to operate exclusively within the **OKLCH color space** is paramount. Its property of perceptual uniformity validates the use of a simple and efficient Euclidean distance metric, **ΔEok** , as a reliable measure of color difference. This crucial link between the color model and the distance metric is what makes the entire system viable.

The specification details a multi-stage model for color transformation. For a single attractor, a pixel's modification is governed by a `tolerance` field mapped to a perceptual radius (ΔEmax​), an `attraction_factor` calculated using a smooth, non-linear easing function, and a final `strength`-scaled linear interpolation. For multiple attractors, their competing influences are resolved through a parallel evaluation and a weighted merge using the **Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW)** algorithm, which elegantly models the "closer is stronger" intuition. The ability to selectively apply these transformations to independent L, C, and H channels further enhances the tool's precision and creative potential.

The provided end-to-end pipeline and detailed pseudocode serve as a direct blueprint for a senior developer, addressing critical implementation details such as color space conversion, gamma correction, and gamut clipping. By following this specification, a robust, predictable, and powerful imaging utility can be constructed.

Finally, the exploration of potential extensions—from GPU acceleration and spatial RBF-based influence to high-fidelity CIEDE2000 metrics and palette- based color transfer—illuminates a clear path forward. The `imgcolorshine` tool, as specified, represents a novel approach to color manipulation. Its true potential lies in its extensibility, promising a future as a versatile and scientifically rigorous platform for both artistic expression and technical color processing.

Thoughts

Understanding the Core Problem

I'm working on creating a technical specification for a Python command-line interface (CLI) tool called `imgcolorshine`. This tool is designed to transform colors within an image based on a set of 'color attractors'. The challenge is to translate the user's conceptual description into a precise, scientifically sound, and developer-ready specification.

Key Research Areas

To achieve this, I've identified several key areas for research. I need to thoroughly understand the Oklch color space, which is the internal color space the tool uses. I also need to define 'tolerance' using a formal color difference metric, such as Euclidean distance in Oklch or CIEDE2000, and mathematically model how 'strength' influences the color transformation. Furthermore, I'll need to develop an algorithm for combining the effects of multiple color attractors, potentially using a weighted approach like Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). Finally, I'll look for analogous concepts in computer graphics and color science to ensure the specification uses established terminology and builds upon existing knowledge.

Next Steps

My immediate next step is to delve into the Oklch color space to understand its components (Lightness, Chroma, Hue), why it's considered perceptually uniform, and its advantages for color manipulation compared to other color spaces like HSL or RGB. This foundational understanding is crucial for the rest of the specification.

Deep Dive into OKLCH

I've gained a solid understanding of the OKLCH color space, which is central to the `imgcolorshine` tool. I've learned that it's composed of Lightness (L), Chroma (C), and Hue (H). A key insight is its 'perceptual uniformity,' meaning that equal numerical changes in L, C, or H correspond to equal perceived changes in color by the human eye. This is a significant advantage over other color models like RGB and HSL, which can lead to unpredictable visual shifts when values are adjusted. This uniformity is particularly beneficial for creating smooth color transitions and predictable color manipulations.

Advantages Over Other Color Spaces

I've identified why OKLCH is superior for this tool's purpose compared to other color spaces. Unlike HSL, OKLCH's lightness values are truly perceptually uniform, ensuring consistent brightness across different hues. Compared to RGB, OKLCH offers more intuitive color manipulation because its components are independent and directly align with human perception. Furthermore, OKLCH improves upon the older CIELAB space, especially in its handling of blue hues, leading to more accurate and uniform results. Another important advantage is its support for wide color gamuts like Display P3, allowing for a broader range of vibrant colors.

Next Research Focus: Color Difference Metrics

With a strong grasp of OKLCH, my next step is to formally define 'tolerance' for the `imgcolorshine` tool. I will now investigate color difference metrics, specifically the Euclidean distance in the Oklab color space (the basis for OKLCH), and also explore CIEDE2000 as a potentially more accurate alternative. I'll also need to determine how to map the user-defined 0-100 'tolerance' value to these scientific metrics.

Defining Color Difference

I've made significant progress in defining the 'tolerance' parameter for the `imgcolorshine` tool. I've confirmed that the Euclidean distance in the Oklab color space is the most suitable metric for calculating perceptual color differences. This aligns perfectly with the tool's internal use of Oklch and offers a good balance between perceptual accuracy and computational efficiency. While I also considered CIEDE2000 for its higher accuracy, its computational cost might be too high for practical image processing within a CLI tool.

Mapping Tolerance to a Metric

A key insight is that the user-defined 0-100 'tolerance' scale will need a clear mapping to a specific Delta E value (Euclidean distance in Oklab). This mapping will be a crucial part of the final specification, as it directly translates the user's intuitive input into a quantifiable color difference.

Next Steps: Modeling Strength

My next focus is to formulate a mathematical model for the 'strength' parameter. I will investigate various interpolation methods, such as linear interpolation and easing functions, to define how a pixel's color is modified based on its distance from a color attractor. I will also consider how the `luminance`, `saturation`, and `hue` booleans will influence this transformation, ensuring a precise and predictable outcome for the tool.

Modeling Color Transformation Strength

I've made good progress in defining the 'strength' parameter for the `imgcolorshine` tool. I've determined that linear interpolation (lerp) is a suitable method for moving a pixel's color towards an attractor's color, with the `strength` parameter directly controlling the interpolation factor. I'm also considering the potential for using easing functions to provide more nuanced and artistic control over the color transitions, allowing for non- linear changes in the rate of color adaptation.

Selective Color Component Adjustment

A key insight is how the `--luminance`, `--saturation`, and `--hue` flags will be implemented. By operating in the Oklch color space, I can selectively apply the interpolation to only the Lightness (L), Chroma (C), or Hue (H) components, ensuring precise control over which aspects of the color are transformed. This leverages the perceptual uniformity and independent axes of the Oklch model.

Next Steps: Weighting Multiple Attractors

My next step is to investigate and specify a weighting algorithm for when multiple color attractors are present. The tool needs a method to combine the influence of these attractors on a single pixel in a 'weighted way.' I will research Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) as a promising candidate for this, exploring how to apply it to color transformations and effectively blend the effects of multiple attractors.

Weighting Multiple Color Attractors

I've successfully determined a robust approach for handling multiple color attractors in the `imgcolorshine` tool. Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) is a highly suitable method for this, where the influence of each color attractor on a pixel is inversely proportional to the color difference between them. This means colors closer to an attractor will be more strongly influenced. The final color of a pixel will be a weighted average of the transformations proposed by each attractor.

Refining Influence with a Power Parameter

A valuable insight from my research into IDW is the inclusion of a 'power' parameter. This parameter allows for fine-tuning how quickly an attractor's influence diminishes with distance. A higher power value will concentrate the effect more locally around the closest attractor, offering greater control over the color transformation's spread.

Next Steps: Analogous Concepts and Terminology

My next step is to research analogous concepts and established terminology in computer graphics and color science. This will help me to ground the `imgcolorshine` tool's functionality within existing scientific frameworks and ensure the specification uses precise and widely understood terms. I'll be exploring concepts like 'palette mapping,' 'color grading,' 'spatial color masks,' 'color transfer,' and 'color harmonization' to see how they relate to the tool's capabilities.

Connecting to Established Concepts

I've successfully identified several analogous concepts from computer graphics and color science that help frame the `imgcolorshine` tool's functionality. It can be understood as a form of 'palette mapping' with a 'soft' influence, where image colors are drawn towards a user-defined palette of attractors rather than strictly quantized. The tool also functions as a novel 'color grading' mechanism, using a physically-inspired 'attractor' model for primary color adjustments, with selective application to luminance, saturation, or hue acting as a form of secondary grading. The 'tolerance' parameter implicitly creates 'color masks,' affecting only colors within a certain range of an attractor, similar to color selection in video editing. Furthermore, it shares similarities with 'color transfer,' where the user-defined attractors act as the color source. The tool can also be used for 'color harmonization' by guiding image colors towards a harmonious attractor palette.

Future Enhancements with Radial Basis Functions

While Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) is a solid foundation for handling multiple attractors, my research also highlighted Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) as a more advanced technique for complex color transformations. This provides a clear path for future extensions to the tool, allowing for even more sophisticated color mapping capabilities beyond the initial specification.

Ready for Specification Generation

I have now gathered all the necessary information to create a comprehensive technical specification for `imgcolorshine`. I have a clear understanding of the Oklch color space, how to define tolerance using Euclidean distance, how to model strength with interpolation and easing functions, and how to handle multiple attractors using IDW. I'm ready to synthesize this research into a detailed document that a senior developer can use for implementation.

# Proposal by You.com

## 19. Introduction

Color manipulation in digital imaging is a field that bridges perceptual psychology, mathematical modeling, and practical engineering. The `imgcolorshine` tool is conceived as a command-line utility that enables users to transform the colors of an image by "attracting" them toward a set of user-defined color attractors, with fine-grained control over which perceptual color dimensions—luminance, chroma (saturation), and hue—are affected. The tool operates internally in the OKLCH color space, a modern, perceptually uniform color space designed for digital imaging and web applications. This report provides a comprehensive scientific foundation for `imgcolorshine`, synthesizing research on color spaces, color difference metrics, palette-based color harmonization, and mathematical models for color attraction. It then presents a clear, implementable specification, ensuring that a senior developer can readily understand and implement the tool.

## 20. Scientific and Technical Foundations

### 20.1. Perceptual Color Spaces: Rationale and Selection

Traditional color spaces such as RGB, HSL, and HSV are not perceptually uniform: equal numerical changes in their coordinates do not correspond to equal perceived changes in color. This leads to unpredictable results when adjusting color attributes, especially in tasks like palette mapping, color grading, or accessibility optimization . Perceptual color spaces, by contrast, are designed so that Euclidean distances between colors correspond more closely to human-perceived differences.

#### 20.1.1. CIELAB and CIELUV

CIELAB and CIELUV, introduced in 1976, model color using three axes: lightness (L*), and two opponent color axes (a*, b* for CIELAB; u*, v\* for CIELUV). They are widely used in color science and industry, but have known non-uniformities, especially in blue hues .

#### 20.1.2. OKLab and OKLCH

OKLab and its cylindrical variant OKLCH are newer spaces (2020) designed to improve on CIELAB’s shortcomings, especially in hue linearity and uniformity, and to support wide-gamut displays . OKLCH represents colors with three parameters: L (perceptual lightness, 0–1), C (chroma, 0–~0.4 for sRGB), and H (hue angle, 0–360°) . This structure allows for independent and intuitive manipulation of each perceptual attribute, making OKLCH especially suitable for tasks like palette generation, color grading, and accessibility adjustments.

### 20.2. Mathematical Models for Color Attraction

#### 20.2.1. Color Distance and Tolerance

The concept of "attracting" colors in an image toward a set of palette colors is rooted in the idea of color difference metrics. In perceptual color spaces, the Euclidean distance between two colors (e.g., in OKLCH or CIELAB) is a good first-order approximation of their perceptual difference . For two colors \( p = (L_p, C_p, H_p) \) and \( a = (L_a, C_a, H_a) \), the distance is:

\[ d(p, a) = \sqrt{w_L (L_p - L_a)^2 + w_C (C_p - C_a)^2 + w_H \cdot \min(|H_p - H_a|, 360 - |H_p - H_a|)^2} \]

where \( w_L, w_C, w_H \) are weights (typically 1, unless the user disables attraction along a channel). The "tolerance" parameter for each attractor defines a maximum color distance (in OKLCH units) within which the attractor exerts influence. Beyond this distance, the attractor has no effect on a given pixel.

#### 20.2.2. Strength and Attraction Function

The "strength" parameter defines how strongly a color within the tolerance is pulled toward the attractor. The most similar color (distance zero) is pulled with full strength; colors at the edge of the tolerance are pulled with zero strength. A common approach is to use a linear or smooth falloff function:

\[ w(d) = \begin{cases} 1 - \frac{d}{T} & \text{if } d < T \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \]

where \( d \) is the color distance, and \( T \) is the tolerance (converted to the same scale as the color space). The user-specified "strength" (0–100) is a multiplier on the maximum attraction, so the final attraction weight is:

\[ w'(d) = S \cdot w(d) \]

where \( S = \text{strength} / 100 \).

#### 20.2.3. Multi-Attractor Blending

When multiple attractors are present, each exerts an independent pull on a pixel's color. The final color is a weighted blend of the original color and the attractor(s), with weights determined by the relative attraction strengths. The most common approach is to compute the normalized sum of all attraction weights for a pixel:

- For each pixel color \( p \), and each attractor \( a_i \) with tolerance \( T_i \) and strength \( S_i \):
  - Compute \( d_i = \text{distance}(p, a_i) \)
  - Compute \( w_i = S_i \cdot (1 - d_i / T_i) \) if \( d_i < T_i \), else 0

The new color is:

\[ p' = \frac{w*0 \cdot p + \sum*{i=1}^N w*i \cdot a_i}{w_0 + \sum*{i=1}^N w_i} \]

where \( w*0 = 1 - \sum*{i=1}^N w_i \) (or simply 1 if all \( w_i = 0 \)), ensuring the original color is preserved if no attractor is close enough. This approach is analogous to palette-based color harmonization and transfer methods in the literature, which use perceptual color distances and weighted blending to achieve smooth, artifact-free results .

#### 20.2.4. Channel-Specific Attraction

The booleans --luminance, --saturation, and --hue allow the user to restrict attraction to specific OKLCH channels. This is implemented by setting the corresponding weights \( w_L, w_C, w_H \) in the distance calculation to 1 or 0. When applying the attraction, only the enabled channels are blended; the others remain unchanged. For example, if only --hue is enabled, only the hue component of the pixel is attracted toward the attractor's hue, with lightness and chroma left untouched.

#### 20.2.5. Gamut Mapping and Clipping

Because OKLCH can represent colors outside the displayable gamut (e.g., sRGB, P3), after transformation, colors must be mapped back into the target gamut. The recommended approach is to reduce chroma (colorfulness) while preserving lightness and hue, as this best preserves perceptual similarity .

### 20.3. Review of Existing Tools and Best Practices

#### 20.3.1. Industry Standards and Guidelines

Color management in digital imaging is governed by a robust framework of international standards, including the ICC profile specification (ISO 15076-1), CIE color spaces (CIEXYZ, CIELAB), and widely adopted color spaces like sRGB and Adobe RGB. The emergence of perceptually uniform spaces such as OKLCH, and their integration into web and application standards, marks a significant advancement in both the science and practice of digital color management .

#### 20.3.2. Similar Tools and Libraries

- **Photoshop Plugins**: Tools like Coolorus and Chameleon Adaptive Palette provide interactive palette mapping and color harmonization, but typically lack the fine-grained, channel-specific, and multi-attractor control described here .
- **Open-Source Libraries**: Libraries such as python-oklch and Color.js provide the necessary color space conversions and interpolation functions, but do not implement the full color attraction model out of the box .
- **GPU-Based Mapping**: The LUT-based approach described by Trapp et al. is suitable for real-time applications and can be adapted for batch processing in Python or other languages .

#### 20.3.3. Best Practices

- **Perceptual Uniformity**: Always perform color manipulations in OKLCH rather than sRGB or HSL to ensure that changes in color values correspond to perceptually uniform changes, avoiding artifacts like hue shifts or inconsistent brightness .
- **Accessibility**: Use OKLCH's lightness channel to adjust contrast for accessibility, as it directly correlates with perceived brightness. Tools like APCA and WCAG contrast algorithms can be used in conjunction with OKLCH to verify and adjust color contrast .
- **Palette Generation**: Generate palettes by fixing lightness and chroma and varying hue evenly around the color wheel, ensuring all colors are equally perceptible .
- **Gamut Awareness**: Always check if the resulting OKLCH color is within the target gamut (sRGB, P3) and provide fallbacks or perform gamut mapping as needed .

## 21. Specification for `imgcolorshine`

### 21.1. Inputs

- **--input_image**: Path to the input image file.
- **--output_image**: (Optional) Path to the output image file. If not provided, auto-generate.
- **Color Attractors**: List of attractors, each specified as:
  ```
  <CSS color specifier>;<tolerance 0-100>;<strength 0-100>
  ```
  - CSS color specifier: Any valid CSS color (e.g., "oklch(0.7 0.15 220)", "#ff0000", "hsl(120, 100%, 50%)", "blue").
  - Tolerance: Maximum color distance (in percent of the maximum possible in OKLCH, e.g., 0–100, mapped to 0–max_distance).
  - Strength: Maximum attraction strength (0–100, as a percent).
- **--luminance**: Boolean. If true, attract L (lightness).
- **--saturation**: Boolean. If true, attract C (chroma).
- **--hue**: Boolean. If true, attract H (hue).

### 21.2. Internal Workflow

#### 21.2.1. Image Loading and Color Space Conversion

- Load the input image and convert all pixels to OKLCH color space using a reliable color management library (e.g., Color.js, python-oklch, or equivalent) .

#### 21.2.2. Attractor Preparation

- For each attractor, parse the CSS color specifier and convert to OKLCH.
- Map tolerance (0–100) to a distance in OKLCH space (e.g., 0–0.4 for chroma, 0–1 for lightness, 0–360 for hue; or normalize to a perceptual distance metric).

#### 21.2.3. Per-Pixel Transformation

For each pixel:

- For each attractor:
  - Compute the channel-masked OKLCH distance between the pixel and the attractor.
  - If within tolerance, compute the attraction weight as: \[ w_i = S_i \cdot (1 - d_i / T_i) \] where \( S_i \) is the strength (0–1), \( d_i \) is the distance, \( T_i \) is the tolerance.
  - If not within tolerance, \( w_i = 0 \).
- For each enabled channel (L, C, H), compute the new value as the weighted average of the original and all attractors, normalized by the sum of weights: \[ V' = \frac{w*0 \cdot V_p + \sum*{i=1}^N w*i \cdot V*{a*i}}{w_0 + \sum*{i=1}^N w*i} \] where \( w_0 = 1 - \sum*{i=1}^N w_i \) (or 1 if all \( w_i = 0 \)), and \( V \) is the selected channel (L, C, or H).
- For disabled channels, retain the original value.

#### 21.2.4. Gamut Mapping

After transformation, check if the new OKLCH color is within the target output gamut (e.g., sRGB). If not, reduce chroma until the color is in-gamut, preserving lightness and hue .

#### 21.2.5. Color Space Conversion and Output

Convert the modified OKLCH values back to the image's original color space (e.g., sRGB). Save the output image to the specified or auto-generated output path.

### 21.3. Edge Cases and Recommendations

- If no attractors are within tolerance for a pixel, the pixel remains unchanged.
- If multiple attractors influence a pixel, their effects are blended proportionally to their weights.
- For hue, ensure circular interpolation and distance calculation.
- For images with alpha channels, process only the color channels; preserve alpha.
- For performance, process images in batches or with vectorized operations.
- Use high-precision (floating-point) color representations during processing to avoid quantization artifacts .

### 21.4. Example

Suppose a user specifies two attractors:

- `oklch(0.8 0.2 30);50;80` (a light, moderately saturated orange, tolerance 50, strength 80)
- `#00bfff;30;60` (a vivid blue, tolerance 30, strength 60)

With `--luminance --saturation --hue` all enabled, the tool will:

- For each pixel, compute its OKLCH distance to both attractors.
- If within 50 units of the orange or 30 units of the blue, compute the respective weights.
- Adjust the pixel's L, C, and H toward the attractor(s), with the amount determined by the weights and strengths.
- If a pixel is within both tolerances, blend the adjustments.
- Convert the result back to sRGB, mapping out-of-gamut colors as needed.

## 22. Scientific Rationale and Expected Image Quality Outcomes

### 22.1. Perceptual Uniformity

Adjustments in OKLCH ensure that changes in luminance, chroma, and hue correspond to visually consistent changes, avoiding artifacts like hue shifts or uneven gradients .

### 22.2. Predictable Blending

The weighted attraction model ensures that only colors perceptually close to an attractor are strongly affected, preserving image structure and avoiding abrupt transitions.

### 22.3. Accessibility and Aesthetics

By enabling independent adjustment of luminance and chroma, the tool can enhance contrast and vibrancy without sacrificing color harmony or introducing accessibility issues .

### 22.4. Gamut Safety

Gamut mapping strategies prevent the introduction of colors that cannot be displayed, maintaining image fidelity.

### 22.5. Empirical Evidence

Studies show that perceptual color spaces like OKLCH and CIELAB enable more consistent color difference perception, smoother gradients, and better accessibility outcomes than non-perceptual spaces .

## 23. Implementation Guidance

### 23.1. Color Parsing

Use a robust parser to handle all CSS color formats, converting them to OKLCH. Open-source libraries such as Color.js, culori, or Python's colour-science can be used for robust color parsing and conversion .

### 23.2. Efficient Processing

For performance, the image should be converted to OKLCH once, and all attraction computations performed in this space. Vectorized operations (e.g., using NumPy) are recommended for speed.

### 23.3. Handling Hue Wrapping

Hue is a circular dimension (0–360°). When computing differences or blending, care must be taken to handle wraparound (e.g., the difference between 359° and 1° is 2°, not 358°).

### 23.4. Output

After transformation, the image is converted back to the desired output color space (e.g., sRGB) for saving. If the output path is not specified, a default should be generated.

## 24. Conclusion

The `imgcolorshine` tool, as specified, is grounded in the latest color science and best practices for perceptual color manipulation. By operating in the OKLCH color space and providing fine-grained, perceptually uniform control over luminance, chroma, and hue, it enables sophisticated, predictable, and visually pleasing color transformations. The scientific literature and practical guides converge on the importance of perceptual color spaces for high-quality image processing, and the specification provided here translates these insights into a clear, implementable algorithm suitable for senior developers and color scientists alike.

The approach not only aligns with the latest advances in color science and digital imaging but also fills a gap in the current ecosystem of color manipulation tools, offering a unique and powerful capability for artists, designers, and developers. By combining channel-specific adaptation, multi-attractor blending, and robust gamut mapping, `imgcolorshine` enables users to achieve sophisticated and perceptually accurate color transformations with fine control over the artistic outcome. Adherence to these standards ensures not only technical correctness but also creative flexibility, accessibility, and interoperability across the ever-evices and platforms.

## 25. Overview

`imgcolorshine` is a Python CLI tool for recoloring images by **pulling pixel colors toward specified “color attractors”** in the perceptually uniform **OKLCH color space**. OKLCH is the cylindrical form of the Oklab color space (L = lightness, C = chroma, h = hue) and was chosen for its good perceptual uniformity and orthogonality of dimensions. Each attractor is defined by:

- **Target Color** – given in any CSS-supported format (named color, `#RRGGBB`, `oklch(L C H)`, `hsl()`, etc.), which will be parsed and converted to OKLCH coordinates.
- **Tolerance** – a radius (0–100 in perceptual units) within which the attractor can influence colors. This corresponds to a maximum perceptual color distance in OKLCH space beyond which the attractor has no effect.
- **Strength** – an influence weight (0–100%) controlling how strongly nearby colors are pulled toward the attractor.

The tool converts the image to OKLCH, then for each pixel computes adjustments based on the attractors. By default, all three OKLCH components (hue, chroma, luminance) are shifted together toward the attractor colors (a full vector adjustment), ensuring natural color moves. The user can optionally toggle adjustments for hue, chroma, or luminance independently via CLI flags (e.g. only adjust hue but preserve lightness/chroma, etc.). The output image is produced by converting the modified OKLCH pixels back to sRGB.

## 26. Perceptual Distance Metric in OKLCH

To determine how “close” a pixel’s color is to an attractor, we use a **perceptual color difference** metric in OKLCH. Because OKLCH/Oklab is designed to be perceptually uniform, a simple Euclidean distance in Oklab space serves as an effective ΔE (color difference) measure. In other words, we treat the OKLCH coordinates (after converting to linear Oklab) similarly to CIELAB:

$ \Delta E*{ok}(color, attractor) = \sqrt{(L*{color} - L*{attr})^2 + (a*{color} - a*{attr})^2 + (b*{color} - b\_{attr})^2} ,$

where $a$ and $b$ are the Cartesian coordinates corresponding to chroma/hue (we convert OKLCH to Oklab for distance calculations). This Oklab Euclidean distance correlates well with perceived color difference – Oklab was derived to match CIEDE2000’s non-uniformity corrections as closely as possible. Using Oklab’s simple Euclidean ΔE yields a fast yet perceptually accurate difference metric, so we adopt that as the default distance model (as opposed to using the more complex CIEDE2000 formula on L*C*h).

**Units:** The tolerance values (0–100) correspond approximately to this ΔE_ok scale. For reference, in CIELAB a ΔE ≈ 2.3 is around a just-noticeable difference for humans; a difference of 100 is the maximum distance (e.g. black to white). Oklab’s scale is similar: 100 covers the full gamut from black to white. Thus a tolerance of 50 would influence colors within a moderate distance, while 5 would be very localized.

## 27. Attractor Influence Function (Tolerance & Strength)

Each attractor defines an “influence field” in color space: colors within its tolerance radius are pulled toward the attractor. We define an **influence weight** $w_i$ for attractor _i_ on a given pixel color based on the pixel’s distance $d_i = \Delta E_{ok}(pixel, attractor_i)$:

$w_i = \frac{S_i}{100} \cdot f\!\Big(\frac{d_i}{T_i}\Big),$

where $T_i$ is the tolerance (radius) and $S_i$ is the strength (%). The function $f(x)$ is a **non-linear falloff curve** that modulates influence by distance. It should satisfy $f(x)=1$ at $x=0$ (zero distance, pixel exactly the attractor color) and $f(x)=0$ for $x \ge 1$ (at the tolerance boundary and beyond). Between 0 and 1 (inside the influence radius), $f(x)$ smoothly decreases from 1 to 0 as $x$ goes to 1. Several falloff profiles are suitable:

- **Smooth Linear** – e.g. $f(x) = 1 - x^p$ for $0 \le x < 1$ (with $p=1$ for linear, or $p=2$ for a faster quadratic drop). This is simple but has a sharp cutoff at $x=1$.
- **Cosine (Raised Cosine)** – e.g. $f(x) = 0.5\,[1 + \cos(\pi x)]$ for $0 \le x \le 1$. This yields a gradual onset and zero first derivative at the boundary, avoiding a sudden cutoff. At $x=1$, $f(1)=0$.
- **Gaussian** – e.g. $f(x) = \exp[-(c x)^2]$ for $x \ge 0$, with a constant $c$ chosen so that $f(1)\approx0$. For example, $c=2$ gives $f(1)=e^{-4}\approx0.018$ (about 2% influence at the edge of tolerance). A Gaussian provides an infinitely smooth decay (technically never reaching zero, but negligible beyond the tolerance). We can truncate it to 0 at $x=1$ for practical purposes.
- **Sigmoid (Logistic)** – a logistic-shaped curve that starts near 1 for small $x$ and drops steeply near $x=1$. For instance, $f(x) = \frac{1}{1+\exp[k\,(x-1)]}$, where a larger $k$ makes the falloff sharper around the tolerance threshold. This allows tuning how gradual or abrupt the cutoff is.
- **Inverse-Distance** – e.g. $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^p + 1}$ for $x < 1$, normalized so $f(0)=1$. Classic inverse-distance weighting (with $p\approx 2$) heavily weights very close colors and rapidly diminishes with distance. (If using a true $1/x^p$ form, one typically includes a small epsilon to avoid singularities at $x=0$. Here we use the "+1" in denominator to bound f(0)=1.)

**Recommended Default:** A raised-cosine or Gaussian falloff is recommended for `imgcolorshine` because it provides a smooth influence that tapers off gently at the tolerance boundary, preventing visible edges. For example, using $f(x) = 0.5\,[1+\cos(\pi x)]$ for $0 \le x \le 1$ gives zero influence exactly at the tolerance distance, and blends continuously inside it. This choice is supported by common practice in color range replacement tools which allow a “falloff” or “feathering” at the edges of the range. The tool could offer multiple falloff modes (linear, smooth, etc.) via CLI options, but the cosine/Gaussian ensures a good default behavior.

Finally, the attractor’s **strength** $S_i$ (0–100%) linearly scales the weight. If $S_i = 100\%$, the attractor has full influence (within its radius) as defined by $f(x)$. Lower strengths proportionally reduce the pull. For example, with strength 50%, even a pixel at the same color as the attractor (distance 0) will only be shifted halfway toward the attractor’s color (because $w_i = 0.5$ instead of 1.0 in that case). Strength thus controls the **magnitude of the color shift** for nearby colors, whereas tolerance controls the **range** of colors affected.

Additionally, any pixel with $d_i \ge T_i$ for a given attractor simply gets $w_i = 0$ for that attractor (no effect outside the tolerance range).

## 28. Blending Multiple Attractors

When multiple attractors are specified, a pixel may fall within the influence of several attractors at once. We need a method to **blend their influences** to compute the pixel’s new color. We consider and compare a few strategies:

- **Maximum Pull (Nearest-Attractor Wins):** Apply only the single attractor with the highest influence on that pixel (e.g. the smallest $d_i$ or largest $w_i$), and ignore others. This is analogous to a Voronoi diagram in color space where each attractor owns a region. While simple, this approach creates hard boundaries where the dominant attractor changes, which can produce visible discontinuities if two attractor regions meet. It doesn’t smoothly blend colors that are influenced by multiple attractors. We generally avoid this except in special “segmentation” modes, since the goal is usually a smooth recoloring.

- **Additive Weighted Shift:** Treat each attractor’s effect as a vector pull on the color and sum them up. In this approach, the pixel color is moved by each attractor’s influence vector $ \Delta \mathbf{v}\_i$ added together. For example, if attractor A wants to shift the pixel toward red and attractor B toward blue, and the pixel lies somewhat under both influences, the net shift is the sum of a “pull toward red” and a “pull toward blue.” This allows multiple influences to combine. However, if many attractors pull in the **same direction**, their effects could sum to more than 100% (potentially overshooting the target colors). Conversely, attractors pulling in opposite directions might cancel each other out in an additive way, potentially leaving the color closer to original (which might be fine or even desired if the pixel is exactly between two targets).

- **Normalized Blending (Inverse Distance Weighted Average):** Compute each attractor’s weight $w_i$ and then normalize the contributions so that they sum to 1 (100%). In practice, we calculate **normalized weights** $\tilde{w}_i = \frac{w_i}{\sum_j w_j}$ (for all attractors $j$ that influence the pixel). The pixel’s new color can then be computed as a **weighted average** of the attractors’ target colors, using these normalized weights. If the sum of weights $\sum_j w_j$ is less than 1, we can conceptually assign the remaining weight to the original color itself – meaning the pixel doesn’t fully shift to the attractors. This gives:

  $Color_{new} = \big(1 - \sum_j w_j \big) \cdot Color_{original} \;+\; \sum_j w_j \cdot Color_{attr_j},$

  for $\sum_j w_j \le 1$. If $\sum_j w_j > 1$ (very strong combined pull), we cap the effect at 100% by setting $\sum_j w_j = 1$ (equivalently, divide each $w_i$ by the sum) so that the formula still holds. This ensures the result is always a mix **between** the original color and the attractor colors, without “overshooting” beyond the attractor hues. In other words, the pixel can be fully recolored to some combination of attractor colors, but not pushed further. This normalized approach is analogous to classic _inverse distance weighting_ in interpolation, where known data points (attractors) influence an unknown point (the pixel) in proportion to their weight, and all weights sum to 1 for a convex combination.

**Chosen Approach:** `imgcolorshine` will use the **normalized blending** strategy by default, as it provides smooth and intuitive results. Colors under multiple attractors smoothly interpolate between those attractor hues, avoiding harsh transitions. The normalization implicitly includes the original color as part of the weighted mix when total influence is weak (if no attractor is very close, the pixel stays mostly unchanged, which is desirable). This method is backed by standard practices in color interpolation and yields stable results.

_Implementation detail:_ To implement this, we first compute raw weights $w_i$ for each attractor as described. Let $W = \sum_i w_i$. If $W > 1$, we scale down all weights by $W$ (i.e. $w_i := w_i / W$) so that they sum to 1. If $W \le 1$, we treat $1 - W$ as the weight of the original color (meaning the pixel keeps some of its original characteristics). The new color in OKLCH can then be obtained by adding up each attractor’s influence vector scaled by $w_i$ (and implicitly adding the original color scaled by weight $1-W$). This ensures a smooth blend that never exceeds 100% transformation. In effect, a pixel exactly equal to an attractor color (distance 0) with strength 100 will move fully to that attractor’s color (since $W=1$ for that one attractor, original weight 0). A pixel midway between two attractors will end up at a color in-between those attractor colors, proportionally closer to the one it was originally nearer.

_Note:_ In scenarios where a crisp, segmented recoloring is desired, a “max-pull” mode could be offered (e.g., via a CLI flag) to assign each color exclusively to the nearest attractor. But for general use, the continuous blending mode above is preferable.

## 29. Color Transformation in OKLCH Space (Vector Application)

With the combined influence determined, we apply the color shift in the OKLCH space as a **full 3D vector adjustment** rather than per-channel tweaks. This means we consider the attractor’s effect on hue, chroma, and lightness together, moving the color toward the attractor in the perceptual color space. Because Oklab/OKLCH was designed to have roughly perceptually orthogonal axes, adjusting the full vector toward the target ensures a natural transformation (the hue, saturation, and brightness changes occur in tandem as needed to approach the target color). This avoids artifacts that might occur if we tried to adjust each component independently or sequentially.

**Vector shift computation:** Conceptually, for each attractor _i_ we determine a target color point in OKLCH (or Oklab) that the pixel would move towards. By default, this target is just the attractor’s OKLCH coordinates. We compute the pixel’s new OKLCH coordinates as a weighted average in Oklab space. In practice, the normalized blending formula already gives us the new color coordinates directly (since we blended either the colors or the difference vectors). For clarity:

- Convert the pixel’s color to Oklab: $\mathbf{v}_{orig} = (L, a, b)$.
- Convert each attractor’s color to Oklab: $\mathbf{v}_{attr_i} = (L_i, a_i, b_i)$.
- Compute weights $w_i$ and normalized weights $\tilde{w}_i$ as above.
- The new color in Oklab is $\mathbf{v}_{new} = (1 - W)\mathbf{v}_{orig} + \sum_i w_i\, \mathbf{v}_{attr_i}$ (if $W \le 1$), or $\sum_i \tilde{w}_i\, \mathbf{v}_{attr_i}$ (if $W > 1$).

This effectively moves the color **in the direction of each attractor** by the fraction given by that attractor’s weight. Because all components are handled together, the hue will shift as needed while lightness and chroma also adjust – the pixel follows the straight-line path in the perceptual space toward the cluster of attractor points. Oklab’s hue uniformity ensures that interpolating in this space avoids weird hue artifacts (for example, there’s no unexpected hue twist when blending between two hues, unlike some issues in CIELAB).

**Channel-Specific Toggles:** The tool allows independent enabling/disabling of hue, chroma, and luminance transformation. These flags limit which dimensions of the color are allowed to change. Implementation-wise, we handle this by modifying the target vectors or the result as follows:

- If **luminance adjustment** is turned **off**, the pixel’s **L (lightness)** should remain as original. We achieve this by ignoring any difference in L between attractors and the original. Concretely, when computing the new color, we set the L component of $\mathbf{v}_{new}$ equal to the original L. (Alternatively, during blending, we can treat all attractors as if they had the same L as the original pixel, so no L shift is computed.) The result is that only chroma and hue shift toward the attractors, but brightness is preserved.
- If **chroma adjustment** is **off**, we keep the pixel’s chroma constant. In Oklab terms, this means the _a_ and _b_ components should change only insofar as hue might change, but the distance from the neutral axis (the chroma) should remain the same. One way to implement this is to adjust hue (if allowed) on the constant-chroma circle. If chroma is off (and hue on), we rotate the pixel’s hue angle toward the attractor’s hue but then reconvert to _a, b_ such that the magnitude $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$ equals the original chroma. If both chroma and hue are off, then obviously _a, b_ remain unchanged (no colorfulness change).
- If **hue adjustment** is **off**, the pixel’s hue is locked – we do not rotate around the L axis. We then allow only lightness and chroma to change. This can be done by projecting the attractor influence onto the direction of the pixel’s hue. For example, for each attractor we consider a version of its color that has the same hue as the pixel (i.e. we drop the hue difference), and use that as the target in blending. This way, the pixel can become lighter/darker or more/less saturated (if luminance/chroma are on) but will not shift its hue angle. If only hue is off (and chroma, luminance on), the pixel moves in the L–C plane (radially inward/outward or up/down along lightness) toward the attractor’s projection at the pixel’s hue angle.

In summary, the algorithm applies the computed color shift only along the allowed dimensions. This is effectively like taking the full 3D difference vector in Oklab and zeroing out the components for any disabled channels. For example, if hue change is disabled, we zero out any _rotation_ component of the difference that would alter the hue angle, using just the difference in L and C. If chroma is disabled, we zero out the _radial_ difference (maintaining the same saturation level). These adjustments ensure the user can constrain the transformation as needed (e.g., only adjust brightness differences but not hues, etc.). The underlying distance computation for influence still uses the full color difference unless it might be more intuitive to adapt it (in most cases we keep using the full ΔE_ok for consistency; the user’s toggles only affect how the shift is applied, not whether a pixel is considered “near” an attractor).

After computing the new pixel color in Oklab/OKLCH, we convert it back to the output color space (sRGB by default). We use the standard Oklab → XYZ → sRGB conversion (ensuring to perform any necessary gamma encoding for sRGB). Because Oklab can represent colors outside sRGB gamut, we will clamp or gamut-map the results to valid sRGB values if needed (for instance, any component <0 or >1 in linear RGB is clipped to \[0,1]). However, since we are often blending colors that likely lie in sRGB, extreme out-of-gamut results are not expected unless attractors were very saturated beyond sRGB.

## 30. Algorithm Outline

Bringing it all together, the implementation proceeds as follows:

1. **Parse Input and Convert Attractors:** Read the source image (e.g. via PIL or OpenCV) and parse the user’s attractor definitions. Each attractor’s CSS color is converted to absolute OKLCH coordinates. For parsing, we can leverage a color library or the CSS Color Level 4 spec which defines `oklch()` and conversions from hex, HSL, etc. (e.g., MDN documentation). We then convert OKLCH to Oklab (cartesian) for easier distance math. Also record each attractor’s tolerance $T_i$ (we interpret the user’s 0–100 value as ΔE in Oklab units) and strength $S_i$.

2. **Convert Image to Oklab:** Convert each pixel from sRGB (or the image’s color space) into Oklab L, a, b. This can be done efficiently by matrix operations on linearized RGB values. (We apply sRGB → XYZ (D65) conversion, then XYZ → Oklab using the published formula or a library function. The conversion involves a fixed 3x3 matrix to LMS, a nonlinear cube-root, and another matrix to Lab.)

3. **Compute New Pixels via Attractors:** For each pixel (in Oklab):

   1. For each attractor _i_, compute $d_i = \sqrt{(L - L_i)^2 + (a - a_i)^2 + (b - b_i)^2}$.
   2. If $d_i > T_i$, set $w_i = 0$ (no influence). If $d_i \le T_i$, compute raw weight $w_i = \frac{S_i}{100} \cdot f(d_i / T_i)$ using the chosen falloff function $f$.
   3. Sum all raw weights $W = \sum_i w_i$.
   4. If $W > 1$, normalize the weights: for all i, set $w_i := w_i / W$ (now $\sum_i w_i = 1$). Otherwise, you may optionally keep an implicit weight for the original color as $w_0 = 1 - W$.
   5. Compute the blended target color in Oklab:

      - If $W < 1$: $v_{new} = w_0 \, v_{orig} + \sum_i w_i \, v_{attr_i}$ (with $w_0 = 1-W$).
      - If $W \ge 1$: $v_{new} = \sum_i w_i \, v_{attr_i}$ (the pixel is fully drawn to the attractors).

   6. If channel toggles are in effect, adjust the components of $v_{new}$ as needed:

      - If luminance (L) is locked, set $L_{new} := L_{orig}$.
      - If chroma is locked, adjust $a_{new}, b_{new}$ to have the same chroma magnitude as $a_{orig}, b_{orig}$ (but in the direction of the new hue if hue is free; if hue is also locked, simply keep $a_{new}, b_{new} := a_{orig}, b_{orig}$).
      - If hue is locked, rotate $a_{new}, b_{new}$ back to the original hue angle while retaining the new chroma (or if chroma also locked, just keep $a_{new}, b_{new}$ unchanged from original).

   7. Store $v_{new}$ as the pixel’s new Oklab value.

4. **Convert Back to Output Color Space:** Convert each new Oklab pixel back to sRGB (apply Oklab → XYZ matrix, then XYZ → sRGB companding). Any values outside \[0,1] in RGB are clipped or mapped. Write out the transformed image.

Throughout this process, numerical stability and performance are considered. Oklab calculations are all straightforward matrix ops and elementary math, which can be vectorized using NumPy for speed. The influence function $f(x)$ (cosine, Gaussian, etc.) is cheap to compute. We should take care at the edges (e.g., if a pixel is exactly the same as an attractor color, $d_i = 0$, our formula gives $w_i = S_i/100$, capped to 1.0 max). Also, when two attractors have very similar colors, a pixel between them will get a blend of both – the normalized approach inherently handles that by averaging their target colors.

## 31. References and Rationale

The above design is grounded in color science best practices and known standards. We operate in the Oklab/OKLCH space because of its improved perceptual uniformity over older models, allowing us to use simple Euclidean ΔE for distance. Oklab was in fact derived to align with the CIEDE2000 perceptual difference model, so Euclidean distances in this space are on par with ΔE 2000 accuracy without its complexity. Using multiple attractors with inverse-distance weighting is analogous to established interpolation techniques and ensures smooth blending between targets. The idea of a falloff curve for influence (tolerance) is similar to how color replacement tools define a soft range, and we’ve suggested functions (Gaussian, etc.) commonly used in radial basis interpolation to achieve a gentle, natural influence gradient. By applying the attractor pulls as full-vector adjustments in OKLCH, we maintain consistent hue and lightness behavior, leveraging OKLCH’s hue-linear and orthogonal properties – this avoids the hue skew artifacts that would arise from naive per-channel tweaks in RGB or even Lab. In summary, `imgcolorshine`’s approach combines a solid perceptual foundation with flexible controls, yielding a reliable color transformation tool for developers and colorists.
