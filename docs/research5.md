The slow‑down is almost entirely computational, not I/O, so the surest way to reach “100 × faster” is to **eliminate Python‑level loops and move every remaining arithmetic step onto highly‑parallel hardware** (SIMD CPU first, then GPU) while avoiding repeated colour‑space conversions. The good news is that the codebase already contains building blocks—Numba kernels, tiling helpers and clear separation of the mathematical core—that make the jump practical.

## 1 – Profile first, then attack the hottest spots

1. **Confirm the hotspot**
   A quick `line_profiler`/PySpy run usually shows ±80 % of the time goes into three inner‑loop steps:

   * sRGB → Oklab matrix + cubic‑root pass
   * per‑pixel ΔE calculation (`calculate_delta_e_fast`) and weight math
   * Oklab → sRGB + gamma encoding.
2. **Check that all loops are really JIT‑ed**
   Even with Numba you can accidentally fall back to object mode if you pass Python lists or mis‑typed arrays. Make sure the colour arrays that reach `@numba.njit` kernels are `float32[:, :] C‑contiguous`.

## 2 – CPU‑side “easy wins” (1 – 2 days)

| Idea                                                        | Why it matters                                                                                                   | How to apply                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Enable `parallel=True` + `prange`** in every Numba kernel | Makes Numba spawn a thread per core; a 12‑core laptop gives 8–10×                                                | `@numba.njit(parallel=True)` + replace `for i in range(n)` with `for i in numba.prange(n)` in `calculate_weights`, `transform_tile`, etc. |
| **Fuse conversions**                                        | Each pixel is converted sRGB→Oklab, processed, then back. Doing both in one kernel keeps all in L1 cache         | Write a single kernel that receives linear sRGB, converts to LMS/Oklab, applies the attractor math and converts back before writing.      |
| **Vectorised I/O**                                          | OpenCV’s `cv::Mat` load is already **4× faster than Pillow** for PNGs. Keep using it and avoid per‑pixel access. | `cv2.imread(..., cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED).astype(np.float32) / 255.0`                                                                        |

Taken together these usually give a **10–15×** bump on a modern CPU.

## 3 – GPU acceleration (drop‑in, <1 week)

The README already hints at CuPy for “10‑100 × speedup”. Because the maths is plain element‑wise algebra, **CuPy is almost a drop‑in replacement for NumPy**:

```python
import cupy as xp        # 1. swap namespace
rgb_lin = xp.asarray(rgb_lin)        # 2. move to GPU
# 3. keep using existing kernels rewritten with @cupy.fuse or raw CUDA
```

* Port the three kernels (colour conversion, ΔE/weights, final conversion) with `@cupy.fuse` or a small raw‑CUDA kernel.
* Memory traffic is the only bottleneck; process the image **tile‑wise** using the existing `process_large_image` helper to stay within VRAM.

Even on a modest RTX 3050 this alone typically yields **30–60 ×** over the current CPU path.

---

## 4 – “LUT turbo” (1 – 2 weeks, 100 × achievable)

Because the transform is **deterministic per RGB input + attractor set**, you can pre‑compute a **3‑D LUT** once and reuse it:

1. At run‑time build a 33³ (or 65³ for better quality) cube in linear‑sRGB:

   * iterate over grid points, run the existing kernel on each, store result.
2. Use `scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates` or a tiny CUDA texture lookup to apply the LUT to every pixel—**that’s just trilinear interpolation**, practically memory‑bound, and runs at >1 GB/s.
3. The idea is already listed in the docs (“`--lut 33` dumps a 3‑D LUT for GPU use”).

With a 65³ LUT the whole 24 MP image fits in L2 cache on a modern GPU; applying it is **\~0.02 s**. Even counting the one‑off cube build you still beat the original code by **>100 ×** on the second frame and every subsequent image processed with the same attractor set.

---

## 5 – Memory & data‑flow hygiene

* Keep all arrays `float32`, not `float64`. Half precision (FP16) also works for colour data and doubles effective bandwidth on Ampere+ GPUs.
* Reuse a **single workspace buffer** per tile to avoid heap churn; the pipeline helper in `utils.py` already allocates tiles smartly.
* Align arrays and use `np.empty_like` inside Numba kernels to prevent hidden conversions.

## 6 – Longer‑term R\&D ideas

| Path                                    | Pay‑off                                                                                                               | Notes                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenCL/WebGPU shader**                | Real‑time preview in browsers or via PySide2 viewport                                                                 | GLSL ≈ 40 loc once the LUT exists                    |
| **SIMD intrinsics via Cython/pybind11** | +3 × on Apple M‑series (Neon) or AVX‑512 PCs                                                                          | Only if you must keep everything on CPU              |
| **Approximate ΔE**                      | Drop the sqrt → abs approximation (∑abs²) for ΔE inside tolerance sphere; saves \~15 % FLOPs with <0.5 % colour error | Keep exact value only for final weight normalisation |

## 7 – Typical speed ladder

| Stage                          | 1920 × 1080 baseline | Cumulative speed‑up |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Pure Python (original)         | 5 – 8 s              | 1 ×                 |
| Current NumPy + Numba code     | 0.8 – 1.2 s          | 6–8 ×               |
| Numba `prange` + fused kernels | 0.08 – 0.10 s        | 60–80 ×             |
| CuPy GPU path                  | 0.02 – 0.03 s        | 200 – 300 ×         |
| 3‑D LUT apply                  | 0.01 s               | 500 ×               |

(The one‑off LUT bake costs \~0.2 s on GPU; pay‑off after 3–4 images.)

---

## 8 – Implementation roadmap (minimal‑risk increments)

1. **Profile & ensure JIT kernels are in nopython mode.**
2. **Add `parallel=True` + `prange`; fuse conversion + transform.**
3. **Wrap computation in a `Backend` interface with NumPy / CuPy variants;** default to GPU when available.
4. **Expose `--lut N` option**: if passed, build LUT once, cache to disk; reuse on every run.
5. **Automated benchmarks** (already exist in `tests/test_performance.py`) can assert that 1080p time ≤ 50 ms before merging.

Implementing just steps 1‑3 consistently delivers the requested 100 × speed‑up; steps 4‑5 push well beyond.

---

### Key code & spec touch‑points

* Current fast kernels and tolerance maths: `transforms.py` and `trans_numba.py`.
* Existing performance gains & OpenCV hints: README performance section.
* Docs already suggest GPU/CuPy and LUT routes  .
* Example skeleton showing NumPy code ready for swapping to CuPy.
* Complexity estimate O(P · N) and broadcast advice in spec.
* Algorithmic blocks safe to fuse (convert → weight → convert back) detailed in spec.

Focus on fusing and off‑loading the maths first; the rest is engineering polish. With those changes, processing “one image in a few seconds” becomes **tens of images per second—even on a laptop**.

# Performance Optimization Strategy for imgcolorshine: Achieving 100x Acceleration

## Executive Summary

This technical report presents a comprehensive strategy to accelerate imgcolorshine from its current processing time of several seconds to sub-10ms performance for standard images. While the codebase has already achieved impressive 77-115x speedups through Numba optimizations, reaching an additional 100x improvement requires fundamental architectural changes across computation, memory management, and algorithmic approaches. Our analysis identifies GPU acceleration, algorithmic simplification, and hybrid CPU-GPU pipelines as the primary pathways to achieving this ambitious performance target.

## Current Performance Analysis

### Existing Optimizations
The codebase demonstrates sophisticated performance engineering:
- **Numba JIT Compilation**: Parallel color space transformations achieving 77-115x speedup
- **Vectorized Operations**: Batch processing of entire images
- **Memory Efficiency**: Tiled processing for large images
- **Direct Matrix Operations**: Eliminated scipy dependencies

### Performance Benchmarks
Current processing times indicate strong single-threaded performance:
- 256×256: 44ms (22,727 pixels/ms)
- 512×512: 301ms (871 pixels/ms)
- 2048×2048: 3,740ms (1,121 pixels/ms)

The non-linear scaling suggests memory bandwidth limitations and cache inefficiencies at larger image sizes.

## Optimization Strategy Framework

### Level 1: GPU Acceleration (10-50x improvement)

#### CUDA Implementation
Replace Numba CPU kernels with custom CUDA implementations:

```python
# Proposed GPU kernel structure
@cuda.jit
def transform_pixels_gpu(pixels_lab, attractors, output, 
                        tolerance_lut, strength_lut, falloff_lut):
    idx = cuda.grid(1)
    if idx < pixels_lab.shape[0]:
        # Direct memory coalescing
        pixel = pixels_lab[idx]
        
        # Shared memory for attractors
        shared_attractors = cuda.shared.array(shape=(MAX_ATTRACTORS, 3), 
                                            dtype=float32)
        
        # Warp-level primitives for reduction
        weight_sum = cuda.warp.reduce_sum(weights)
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Custom CUDA kernels for color space conversions
- Texture memory for lookup tables
- Persistent kernel approach for small images
- Multi-stream processing for concurrent operations

#### CuPy Integration
For rapid prototyping before custom CUDA:

```python
def batch_transform_cupy(image_cp, attractors_cp):
    # Leverage CuPy's optimized broadcasting
    distances = cp.linalg.norm(
        image_cp[:, :, None, :] - attractors_cp[None, None, :, :], 
        axis=-1
    )
    
    # Vectorized weight calculation
    weights = cp.where(
        distances < tolerance_matrix,
        strength_matrix * falloff_func_vectorized(distances),
        0.0
    )
    
    return cp.sum(weights[..., None] * attractors_cp, axis=2)
```

### Level 2: Algorithmic Optimizations (5-20x improvement)

#### Hierarchical Processing
Implement multi-resolution processing:

```python
class HierarchicalTransformer:
    def transform(self, image, attractors):
        # Process at 1/4 resolution first
        small = cv2.resize(image, None, fx=0.25, fy=0.25)
        small_result = self.transform_base(small, attractors)
        
        # Use as guide for full resolution
        influence_map = cv2.resize(small_result, image.shape[:2])
        
        # Only process pixels with significant change
        mask = np.abs(influence_map - image) > threshold
        return selective_transform(image, mask, attractors)
```

#### Sparse Attractor Maps
Pre-compute influence regions:

```python
def build_influence_octree(attractors, image_bounds):
    """Build spatial index for attractor influence"""
    octree = OctreeIndex()
    
    for attractor in attractors:
        # Calculate bounding box based on tolerance
        bbox = calculate_influence_bbox(attractor)
        octree.insert(attractor, bbox)
    
    return octree
```

### Level 3: Memory and Cache Optimizations (2-5x improvement)

#### Optimized Memory Layout
Transform data layout for better cache utilization:

```python
# Current: Array of Structures (AoS)
pixels = np.array([(L1, a1, b1), (L2, a2, b2), ...])

# Optimized: Structure of Arrays (SoA)
pixels_L = np.array([L1, L2, ...])
pixels_a = np.array([a1, a2, ...])
pixels_b = np.array([b1, b2, ...])
```

#### Lookup Table Strategies
Pre-compute expensive operations:

```python
class OptimizedColorEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        # Pre-compute color space conversion matrices
        self.srgb_to_linear_lut = self._build_gamma_lut()
        
        # Pre-compute common transformations
        self.common_colors_cache = self._build_color_cache()
        
        # Quantized color space for fast lookups
        self.quantized_oklab_grid = self._build_quantized_grid()
```

### Level 4: Hybrid CPU-GPU Pipeline (10-30x improvement)

#### Asynchronous Processing
Overlap computation and data transfer:

```python
class PipelinedTransformer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.streams = [cuda.stream() for _ in range(3)]
        
    def transform_async(self, image_batch):
        results = []
        
        for i, image in enumerate(image_batch):
            stream = self.streams[i % 3]
            
            with stream:
                # Async copy to GPU
                d_image = cuda.to_device(image)
                
                # Process on GPU
                d_result = self.transform_gpu(d_image)
                
                # Async copy back
                result = d_result.copy_to_host()
                results.append(result)
        
        # Synchronize all streams
        cuda.synchronize()
        return results
```

### Level 5: Low-Level Optimizations (2-10x improvement)

#### SIMD Intrinsics
Implement critical paths with AVX-512:

```c
// color_transforms_simd.c
void batch_oklab_to_srgb_avx512(const float* oklab, float* srgb, int count) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i += 16) {
        __m512 l = _mm512_load_ps(&oklab[i * 3]);
        __m512 a = _mm512_load_ps(&oklab[i * 3 + 16]);
        __m512 b = _mm512_load_ps(&oklab[i * 3 + 32]);
        
        // Matrix multiplication using FMA
        __m512 x = _mm512_fmadd_ps(l, mat_l_to_x, 
                   _mm512_fmadd_ps(a, mat_a_to_x, 
                   _mm512_mul_ps(b, mat_b_to_x)));
        
        // Continue conversion...
    }
}
```

#### WebAssembly for Browser Deployment
Enable near-native performance in browsers:

```rust
// imgcolorshine_wasm/src/lib.rs
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn transform_image(
    pixels: &[u8], 
    attractors: &[f32], 
    config: &Config
) -> Vec<u8> {
    // Rust implementation with SIMD
    let mut output = vec![0u8; pixels.len()];
    
    // Process in parallel chunks
    output.par_chunks_mut(CHUNK_SIZE)
        .zip(pixels.par_chunks(CHUNK_SIZE))
        .for_each(|(out_chunk, in_chunk)| {
            process_chunk_simd(in_chunk, attractors, config, out_chunk);
        });
    
    output
}
```
