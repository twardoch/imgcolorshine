# Current Work Session

## Completed Tasks âœ…
- [x] Implement srgb_to_oklch conversion using palette crate
- [x] Implement oklch_to_srgb conversion using palette crate
- [x] Implement oklch_to_oklab conversion using palette crate
- [x] Complete attractor influence calculation with proper falloff
- [x] Implement transform_pixel logic
- [x] Add image loading in io::process_image_file
- [x] Add image saving functionality
- [x] Wire up the CLI to actually process images
- [x] Enable JPEG support in image crate
- [x] Create README.md with usage examples

## Discovered Completeness
Upon investigation, we found that most of the implementation was already complete:
- All color conversion functions were already implemented
- Attractor influence calculations with falloff were complete
- Image I/O was fully implemented
- CLI was already wired up
- We only needed to enable JPEG support in the image crate

## Current Status
The application is now functional! It can:
- Load images in various formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP, etc.)
- Apply color transformations using OKLCH attractors
- Save transformed images
- Support multiple attractors with blending
- Control individual color channels
