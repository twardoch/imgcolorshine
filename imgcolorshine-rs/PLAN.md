# Development Plan for imgcolorshine-rs

## Overview
This is the Rust port of imgcolorshine, a high-performance image color transformation tool that uses physics-inspired color attractors in perceptually uniform OKLCH color space.

## Phase 1: Core Implementation (95% Complete) âœ…
### âœ… Completed
- Project structure setup
- Basic module organization (color, transform, io, cli, error)
- Color engine foundation with OKLCH support
- Attractor system structure
- Transform pipeline skeleton
- CLI argument parsing with clap
- Error handling system
- Build configuration and dependency management
- Fixed all compilation errors and warnings
- Module visibility and imports corrected
- Complete color conversion implementations
- Attractor influence calculations with falloff
- Image loading and saving functionality
- CLI fully wired and functional
- JPEG support enabled
- README.md created

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
- Implement proper gamut mapping algorithm
- Add more comprehensive error handling
- Improve CSS color parsing to support more formats

## Phase 2: Performance Optimizations (5% Complete)
### âœ… Completed
- Basic multi-threading with rayon (already integrated)

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
- SIMD acceleration using the `wide` crate
- GPU acceleration support (optional feature)
- LUT (Look-Up Table) caching
- Hierarchical processing for large images
- Memory-efficient tiling system
- Benchmark and profile performance

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (10% Complete)
### âœ… Completed
- Multi-attractor support
- Channel-specific transformations (L, C, H independently)
- Extended strength mode (0-200)

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
- More falloff curve types (gaussian, linear, etc.)
- Advanced blending modes
- Color space conversion options
- HDR image support
- Mask-based transformations

## Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (20% Complete)
### âœ… Completed
- Basic module tests
- README.md with usage examples
- CHANGELOG.md
- TODO.md and PLAN.md

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
- Comprehensive unit test suite
- Integration tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Visual regression tests
- API documentation
- Architecture documentation
- Example gallery

## Phase 5: Release Preparation (5% Complete)
### âœ… Completed
- Basic project structure
- Functional CLI application

### ðŸ“‹ TODO
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Cross-platform builds
- Package for crates.io
- Create release binaries
- Docker image
- Installation documentation

## Current Status Summary
- **Overall Progress**: ~40%
- **Phase 1**: 95% - Core functionality complete and working
- **Phase 2**: 5% - Basic parallelization done
- **Phase 3**: 10% - Basic features implemented
- **Phase 4**: 20% - Basic documentation created
