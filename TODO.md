# TODO

TASK: Work through the steps below. Once you've completed a step, mark it with `[x]`. Always use `uv` or `hatch` or `python`, not `python3`.

## [ ] Task 1

Review `PLAN.md` and rewrite it so that: 

- Remove all completed items from `PLAN.md`. 
- Keep only things that are TBD. 
- Update `PLAN.md` so that it includes a plan to fix the TBDs and the items resulting from the problems below: 


## [x] Task 2

after `uvx hatch clean; uvx hatch build` the file `./dist/imgcolorshine-3.3.2.tar.gz` contains this: 

```
dist/imgcolorshine-3.3.2
├── LICENSE
├── PKG-INFO
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── src
    └── imgcolorshine
        ├── __version__.py
        └── py.typed

3 directories, 6 files
```

This is bullshit. 

## [ ] Task 3

Where are the binaries from the mypyc compilation? How should I build them? Are they integrated into `pyproject.toml`? If not, fix this. 

## [ ] Task 4

Actually read `PLAN.md` and implement the tasks therein.
