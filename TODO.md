# imgcolorshine Performance Optimization Plan

### [x] 1 Hierarchical Processing ✅

- [x] Process at 1/4 resolution first
- [x] Use low-res result as influence map
- [x] Only process pixels that differ significantly from influence map
- [x] Implement adaptive subdivision for gradients

### [x] 2 Spatial Acceleration Structures ✅

- [x] Build KD-tree of attractor influence regions
- [x] Early-exit pixels outside all influence radii
- [x] Use spatial coherence for tile-based processing
