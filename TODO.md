# TODO

## Phase 1

Iâ€™ve ran `./testdata/example.sh` and it worked, but all image outputs look kind of the same. Look at `./testdata/louis.jpg` vs. `./testdata/output/louis-blue-80-80.jpg`. Since the attractor is blue, I would have expected some variation in the jacket. 

`PLAN.md` has a plan for fixing/improving the codebase. The `docs` folder contains additional historical research notes. 

- [ ] Read `PLAN.md` and implement the tasks.
