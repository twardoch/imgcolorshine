# TODO

Use `uv` or `hatch` or `python`, not `python3`. 

- [ ] Analyze full codebase from llms.txt
- [ ] Identify which tests are not covered
- [ ] Identify which tests are not working
- [ ] Write into `PLAN.md` a detailed plan for writing additional tests, and for fixing the failing tests. Note: sometimes we need to fix the code in `src` but sometimes it makes more sense to fix the tests in `tests`, because the tests are not adequare or are outdated.  
- [ ] Also write into `PLAN.md` very clear instructions that encourage to run tests, review, revise, improve, iterate.
