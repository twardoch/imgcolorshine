# imgcolorshine Performance Optimization Plan

### [ ] 1 Hierarchical Processing

- [ ] Process at 1/4 resolution first
- [ ] Use low-res result as influence map
- [ ] Only process pixels that differ significantly from influence map
- [ ] Implement adaptive subdivision for gradients

### [ ] 2 Spatial Acceleration Structures

- [ ] Build KD-tree of attractor influence regions
- [ ] Early-exit pixels outside all influence radii
- [ ] Use spatial coherence for tile-based processing
