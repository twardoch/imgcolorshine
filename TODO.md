# TODO

TASK: Work through the steps below. Once you've completed a step, mark it with `[x]`. Always use `uv` or `hatch` or `python`, not `python3`. 

## Completed Tasks âœ…

1. [x] Analyze `PLAN.md` and analyze the entire codebase in `llms.txt`
2. [x] Analyze the recent git history. 
3. [x] Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the latest changes.
4. [x] Remove from `PLAN.md` tasks that are actually already accomplished. 
5. [x] Read `tests/COVERAGE_REPORT.md` and `tests/TESTING_WORKFLOW.md` and update them with the latest changes.
6. [x] Start working on remaining tasks in `PLAN.md`.
7. [x] As you work, check off tasks in `PLAN.md` as you complete them.
8. [x] When you've completed a task, run `./cleanup.sh` and then check `cleanup.log` and fix problems.
