## What is imgcolorshine?

`imgcolorshine` is a sophisticated command-line tool that uses a unique "color attractor" model to transform image colors. You define specific target colors, and the tool intelligently pulls the existing colors of your image towards these attractors, creating smooth, organic, and natural-looking transformations.

All color operations are performed in the **OKLCH color space**, which is perceptually uniform, ensuring that changes correspond directly to how humans perceive color qualities.

## Quick TLDR

## Documentation Overview

This documentation is organized into 9 comprehensive chapters:

### [Chapter 1: Installation](installation.md)
**TLDR:** Install from PyPI with `pip install imgcolorshine`. Optional GPU acceleration available with CuPy.

Learn how to install imgcolorshine on different platforms, set up optional dependencies for GPU acceleration, and verify your installation.

### [Chapter 2: Quick Start](quickstart.md) 
**TLDR:** Basic syntax is `imgcolorshine shine input.jpg "color;tolerance;strength"`. Start with moderate values like `"orange;50;75"`.

Get up and running quickly with practical examples and your first color transformations.

### [Chapter 3: Basic Usage](basic-usage.md)
**TLDR:** Attractors use format `"color;tolerance;strength"` where tolerance (0-100) is percentile-based influence and strength (0-200) controls transformation intensity.

Master the fundamental concepts of color attractors, tolerance, and strength parameters through detailed examples.

### [Chapter 4: Understanding Attractors](understanding-attractors.md)
**TLDR:** Attractors use a physics-inspired "pull" model in OKLCH space. Tolerance is adaptive percentile-based, not fixed radius.

Deep dive into the attractor model, how tolerance works as a percentile system, and the physics-inspired transformation approach.

### [Chapter 5: Advanced Features](advanced-features.md)
**TLDR:** Control individual L/C/H channels, use multiple attractors, batch processing, and extended strength modes for duotone effects.

Explore channel-specific transformations, multi-attractor blending, batch processing workflows, and advanced strength modes.

### [Chapter 6: Performance Optimization](performance-optimization.md)
**TLDR:** Enable GPU with CuPy, use 3D LUTs (`--lut_size=65`) for repeated transformations, and leverage hierarchical processing for large images.

Maximize performance with GPU acceleration, lookup tables, fused kernels, and optimization strategies for different use cases.

### [Chapter 7: Color Science](color-science.md)
**TLDR:** All operations in perceptually uniform OKLCH/Oklab space with professional CSS Color Module 4 compliant gamut mapping.

Understand the color science behind imgcolorshine, including OKLCH color space, perceptual uniformity, and gamut mapping.

### [Chapter 8: API Reference](api-reference.md)
**TLDR:** Python API available for programmatic use with `OKLCHEngine`, `ColorTransformer`, and batch processing functions.

Complete reference for the Python API, command-line options, and programmatic usage.

### [Chapter 9: Development](development.md)
**TLDR:** Modular architecture with fast_mypyc and fast_numba optimizations. Uses Ruff for linting, pytest for testing.

Learn about the codebase architecture, development setup, contributing guidelines, and extending imgcolorshine.
