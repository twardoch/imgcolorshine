# PLAN - imgcolorshine Improvement Roadmap

## Executive Summary

imgcolorshine has successfully completed Phase 1 of its architecture refactor, establishing a solid three-tier structure with Numba and Mypyc optimizations. The next phase focuses on resolving build issues, improving stability, enhancing usability, and preparing for broader deployment.

## Current State Analysis (as of 2025-06-29)

### Achievements
- ✅ Three-tier architecture implemented (Pure Python → Numba → Mypyc)
- ✅ Core functionality consolidated and optimized
- ✅ Test coverage improved from 41% to 50%
- ✅ Comprehensive README documentation
- ✅ Performance optimizations (GPU, LUT, fused kernels)

### Outstanding Issues
- ❌ Mypyc build errors preventing wheel compilation
- ❌ Test failures in some edge cases
- ❌ Limited platform testing (mainly macOS)
- ❌ No Docker/containerization support
- ❌ Missing API documentation
- ❌ No CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Phase 2: Stability & Build System (Immediate Priority)

### Goal
Resolve all build issues and establish a robust testing infrastructure.

### 2.1 Fix Mypyc Compilation Errors
**Problem**: Mypyc compilation fails during wheel building, preventing performance benefits.

**Root Causes**:
1. Import cycles between modules
2. Type annotation issues with numpy arrays
3. Missing type stubs for dependencies

**Solution Steps**:
1. **Analyze import dependencies**
   - Create import dependency graph
   - Identify and break circular imports
   - Move shared types to dedicated module

2. **Fix type annotations**
   - Use `numpy.typing.NDArray` consistently
   - Add proper type stubs for coloraide
   - Ensure all mypyc modules have complete annotations

3. **Implement fallback mechanism**
   - Create pure Python versions of mypyc modules
   - Use try/except imports with graceful degradation
   - Add environment variable to disable mypyc

### 2.2 Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure
**Goal**: Achieve 80%+ test coverage with CI/CD automation.

1. **Expand test suite**
   - Add property-based testing with Hypothesis
   - Create performance regression tests
