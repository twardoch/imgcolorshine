# color-transformation-algorithms

Core color transformation algorithms implementing physics-inspired color attractors in perceptually uniform color space.

## Attraction Model (Importance: 95)
- Physics-inspired "pull" model where attractor colors exert gravitational-like influence
- Distance-based attraction using perceptual ΔE in Oklab space
- Tolerance parameter (0-100) maps to maximum influence radius (0-2.5 ΔE)
- Strength parameter (0-100) controls maximum pull at zero distance
- Raised cosine falloff ensures smooth color transitions

Location: src/imgcolorshine/color.py

## Channel-Specific Transformations (Importance: 90)
- Independent control over luminance, saturation and hue channels
- Circular weighted averaging for hue blending
- Normalized multi-attractor influence blending
- Selective channel enabling/disabling with integrity preservation

Location: src/imgcolorshine/kernel.py

## Color Space Pipeline (Importance: 85)
- Complete transformation chain: sRGB ↔ Oklab ↔ OKLCH
- CSS Color Module 4 compliant gamut mapping
- Binary search chroma reduction for out-of-gamut colors
- Perceptual uniformity preservation throughout pipeline

Location: src/imgcolorshine/trans_numba.py

## Falloff Functions (Importance: 80)
- Raised cosine default for natural color transitions
- Gaussian option for centered influence
- Linear/quadratic/cubic alternatives for different attraction behaviors
- Distance-weighted influence calculation

Location: src/imgcolorshine/falloff.py

The core innovation lies in combining physical attraction models with perceptually uniform color spaces to create natural-looking color transformations while preserving visual relationships between colors.
