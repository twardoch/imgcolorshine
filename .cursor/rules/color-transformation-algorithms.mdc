## Core Color Transformation Engine

The color transformation engine implements a physics-inspired model operating in OKLCH perceptual color space:

1. **Attractor Model** (Importance: 95)
- Implements gravitational-style color attraction
- Colors are "pulled" toward attractor points based on perceptual distance
- Attractor influence determined by tolerance (percentile-based) and strength parameters
- Support for multiple weighted attractors with blending

2. **Falloff Functions** (Importance: 85) 
- Custom falloff curves control attraction strength vs distance
- Raised cosine falloff provides smooth transitions
- Strength parameter above 100% flattens falloff curve
- Adaptive influence based on image color distribution

3. **Perceptual Color Processing** (Importance: 90)
- All operations performed in OKLCH perceptual color space
- Independent control of lightness, chroma and hue channels
- Adaptive percentile-based tolerance calculation
- Seamless blending of multiple color influences

4. **Gamut Mapping** (Importance: 80)
- CSS Color Module 4 compliant gamut mapping
- Preserves perceptual attributes while ensuring displayability
- Binary search for maximum in-gamut chroma
- Smooth handling of out-of-gamut colors
