## Core Color Space Model Components

### OKLCH Color Engine
Score: 95
- File: src/imgcolorshine/color.py
- Implements perceptually uniform OKLCH color space model
- Manages color transformations between RGB, Oklab and OKLCH spaces
- Handles gamut mapping to ensure colors remain within sRGB display capabilities
- Provides channel-specific transformations for lightness, chroma and hue

### Gamut Mapping
Score: 90
- File: src/imgcolorshine/gamut.py
- CSS Color Module 4 compliant gamut mapping
- Binary search algorithm for finding maximum in-gamut chroma
- Preserves perceptual color attributes during mapping
- Handles edge cases for colors far outside sRGB gamut

### Color Space Conversions
Score: 85
- File: src/imgcolorshine/trans_numba.py
- Optimized conversions between RGB, Oklab and OKLCH
- Vectorized operations for batch color processing
- Handles numerical precision and edge cases
- Maintains color accuracy during transformations

## Color Transformation Pipeline

### Attractor-Based Color Model
Score: 95
- Defines color attractors in OKLCH space
- Each attractor has color, tolerance and strength parameters
- Colors are "pulled" toward attractors based on distance
- Smooth transitions using physics-inspired model 

### Multi-Channel Processing
Score: 80
- Independent control of lightness, chroma and hue channels
- Channel-specific tolerance and strength parameters
- Preserves untransformed channels
- Blends multiple attractor influences

### Perceptual Color Distance
Score: 85
- Implements perceptually uniform color difference metrics
- Used for attractor influence calculations
- Handles edge cases and numerical stability
- Ensures color changes match human perception
