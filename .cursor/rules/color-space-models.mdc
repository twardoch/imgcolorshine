## Core Color Space Models

### OKLCH Color Space (Importance: 95)
- Perceptually uniform color space using Lightness, Chroma, and Hue coordinates
- Primary working space for all color transformations
- Enables natural-looking color adjustments due to perceptual uniformity
- Implemented in `color_engine.py` with bidirectional conversions to/from Oklab

### Oklab Color Space (Importance: 90)
- Linear transformation of OKLCH used for accurate distance calculations
- Provides perceptually uniform color differences
- Used for calculating attraction influence between colors
- Core transformations in `transforms.py` handle Oklab-based color operations

### RGB Color Space (Importance: 85)
- Input/output color space for image processing
- Gamut mapping ensures colors remain within displayable sRGB range
- Implemented in `gamut.py` with CSS Color Module 4 compliant mapping

## Color Space Transformations

### Bidirectional Conversions (Importance: 92)
- RGB ↔ Oklab: Linear transformation preserving perceptual uniformity
- Oklab ↔ OKLCH: Polar coordinate conversion for intuitive color manipulation
- Located in `color_engine.py`

### Gamut Mapping (Importance: 88)
- Maps out-of-gamut colors back to displayable sRGB range
- Preserves lightness and hue while reducing chroma
- Implements CSS Color Module 4 specification
- Core functionality in `gamut.py`

### Multi-Space Operations (Importance: 86)
- Color attraction calculations performed in Oklab space
- Visual transformations applied in OKLCH space
- Final output converted to RGB space
- Implemented across `transforms.py` and `color_engine.py`
