### Image Processing Pipeline Architecture

The data flow pipeline consists of several key stages that handle large image processing efficiently:

#### 1. Memory-Aware Tiling System
- Analyzes image dimensions and available memory to determine optimal tile sizes
- Implements automatic tiling with overlap regions to prevent edge artifacts
- Located in: `src/imgcolorshine/io.py`

#### 2. Color Space Transformation Flow
- Converts input tiles to OKLCH color space 
- Processes transformations in perceptually uniform space
- Maps results back to output color space
- Located in: `src/imgcolorshine/transform.py`

#### 3. Spatial Acceleration Structure
Implements a hierarchical grid system for optimizing color transformations:
- Subdivides image into regions based on color similarity
- Groups similar regions to reduce redundant calculations
- Located in: `src/imgcolorshine/spatial.py`

#### 4. Multi-Resolution Processing
- Processes image at multiple scales, starting with lowest resolution
- Propagates results to higher resolutions
- Preserves fine details while accelerating processing
- Located in: `src/imgcolorshine/engine.py`

#### 5. Stream Processing Pipeline
- Processes tiles sequentially to minimize memory usage
- Implements producer-consumer pattern for tile processing
- Located in: `src/imgcolorshine/io.py`

### Critical Data Flows

1. **Input Processing Flow**
```
Load Image -> Split into Tiles -> Convert Color Space -> Process Tiles -> Merge Results
```

2. **Tile Processing Flow**  
```
Get Tile -> Apply Color Transform -> Handle Edge Cases -> Write Back
```

3. **Memory Management Flow**
```
Check Size -> Calculate Tiles -> Allocate Buffers -> Process -> Release
```
