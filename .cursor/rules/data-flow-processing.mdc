## Core Processing Pipeline

The image processing pipeline implements a multi-stage color transformation system:

1. Image Tiling System
- Automatic tile size determination (default 1024x1024)
- Overlap handling for seamless tile boundaries
- Memory-aware tiling for images >2GB

2. Color Processing Stages 
- Color space conversion: sRGB → Oklab → OKLCH
- Attraction calculation per pixel/tile
- Gamut mapping and back-conversion
- Result assembly from processed tiles

3. Acceleration Methods
- GPU acceleration with CuPy for parallel tile processing
- 3D Color LUT with caching for repeated transformations
- Hierarchical multi-resolution for large images
- Spatial acceleration for local coherence

## Memory Management

1. Tile Management
- Automatic tile sizing based on available memory
- Overlap regions for continuous color transitions
- Progressive tile loading/unloading

2. Cache Systems
- LUT caching for repeated transformations 
- Tile analysis results caching
- Intermediate color conversion caching

## Data Flow Components

1. Input Processing
- Image loading and color space conversion
- Tile generation and scheduling
- Parameter validation and normalization

2. Color Transformation
- Per-tile parallel processing
- Multi-attractor influence calculation
- Channel-specific transformations
- Result merging and boundary handling

3. Output Assembly
- Tile recombination with overlap handling
- Final color space conversion
- Memory-efficient result writing
