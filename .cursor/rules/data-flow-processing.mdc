## Core Data Flow Pipeline

1. **Image Loading and Tiling**
`src/imgcolorshine/io.py`
- Smart tiling system determines optimal tile sizes based on image dimensions and available memory
- Tiles are processed with overlap regions to prevent edge artifacts
- Memory estimation logic pre-calculates required memory and enforces tiling when needed
Importance: 85

2. **Color Space Transformation Pipeline**
`src/imgcolorshine/transforms.py`
- Implements multi-stage color transformation pipeline:
  1. RGB to OKLCH conversion
  2. Attractor influence calculation
  3. Color blending based on attractor weights
  4. Gamut mapping
  5. OKLCH to RGB conversion
- Each stage processes data in chunks to maintain memory efficiency
Importance: 95

3. **LUT-Based Acceleration**
`src/imgcolorshine/lut.py`
- Caches frequently used color transformations in a 3D lookup table
- Streaming architecture for LUT updates to avoid memory spikes
- Automatic LUT invalidation when transformation parameters change
Importance: 80

4. **GPU Memory Management**
`src/imgcolorshine/gpu.py`
- Implements smart batching for GPU processing based on available VRAM
- Asynchronous data transfer between CPU and GPU
- Automatic fallback to CPU when GPU memory is insufficient
Importance: 75

## Data Flow Control

1. **Hierarchical Processing**
- Multi-resolution processing pipeline starting with downsampled image
- Progressive refinement with increasing resolution
- Results from lower resolutions guide higher resolution processing
Importance: 90

2. **Memory-Mapped Processing**
- Large images processed using memory-mapped files
- Streaming architecture for minimal memory footprint
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files
Importance: 85

3. **Processing Coordination**
- Dynamic scheduling of transformation operations
- Dependency tracking between processing stages
- Parallel processing of independent image regions
Importance: 80
