## Core Data Pipeline Components

### Tiled Image Processing (Importance: 95)
- Located in `src/imgcolorshine/transforms.py`
- Processes large images in memory-efficient tiles 
- Each tile undergoes color space conversion -> transformation -> gamut mapping
- Adjacent tiles are processed with overlap to prevent edge artifacts
- Automatic tile size calculation based on available system memory

### Memory Management System (Importance: 90)
- Located in `src/imgcolorshine/utils.py`
- Implements dynamic memory allocation for image tiles
- Estimates optimal tile dimensions based on:
  - Input image dimensions
  - Color channel count
  - Available system memory
  - Processing overhead requirements

### Data Flow Orchestration (Importance: 85)
Located in `src/imgcolorshine/transforms.py`:
- Controls pipeline stages:
  1. Image loading and validation
  2. Color space conversion (RGB -> OKLCH)
  3. Per-tile attractor application
  4. Gamut mapping
  5. Color space reversion (OKLCH -> RGB)
  6. Result composition

### Image I/O Stream Management (Importance: 80)
Located in `src/imgcolorshine/image_io.py`:
- Handles streaming of image data between disk and memory
- Implements progressive loading for large images
- Manages intermediate buffer allocation
- Controls output stream writing with proper synchronization

### Pipeline-Specific Data Structures
Located in `src/imgcolorshine/transforms.py`:
- TileDescriptor: Manages tile metadata and processing state
- TransformBuffer: Handles intermediate color transformation results
- ProcessingContext: Maintains pipeline state and configuration

### Key Data Flows

1. Input Stream:
```
Disk -> Image Loader -> Tile Generator -> Processing Queue
```

2. Processing Stream:
```
Tile -> Color Transform -> Attractor Application -> Gamut Mapping -> Result Buffer
```

3. Output Stream:
```
Result Buffer -> Tile Composer -> Image Writer -> Disk
```
