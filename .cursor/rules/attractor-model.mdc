# attractor-model

The attractor model represents the core unique business logic for transforming image colors using physics-inspired "color attractors". The model operates entirely in perceptually uniform OKLCH color space.

## Key Components

### 1. Color Attraction Model (90/100)
- Each attractor has a target color, tolerance (radius of influence), and strength
- Tolerance is implemented as a percentile (0-100) rather than absolute distance
- A tolerance of 50 means the attractor influences the 50% most similar pixels
- The strength parameter (0-200) controls both intensity and falloff behavior
- Strength > 100 progressively flattens the falloff curve

### 2. Distance-Based Influence (85/100) 
- Influence is calculated using perceptual distance in OKLCH space
- Falloff is smooth and continuous using raised cosine function
- Multi-attractor blending uses normalized weighted average
- Each pixel is influenced more by closer attractors
- Strength parameter modulates both intensity and distance sensitivity

### 3. Channel-Specific Transforms (80/100)
- Independent control over lightness, chroma and hue channels
- Transforms preserve perceptual uniformity in each channel
- Channel-specific tolerances allow targeted adjustments
- Blending happens independently in each channel
- Channel mixing handled in perceptually uniform space

### 4. Gamut Mapping (75/100)
- Out-of-gamut colors mapped back to sRGB using CSS Color 4 approach  
- Perceptual attributes preserved during gamut mapping
- Chroma reduced while maintaining lightness and hue
- Gamut mapping applied after attractor transformations
- Result guaranteed to be within sRGB gamut
