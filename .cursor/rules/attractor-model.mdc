# attractor-model

The attractor model implements a physics-inspired color transformation system operating in OKLCH perceptual color space.

## Core Components

### Color Attraction System
Importance Score: 95
- Each attractor color acts as a gravitational center in OKLCH space
- Influence determined by perceptual color distance (ΔE in Oklab)
- Tolerance radius maps 0-100 to 0-2.5 ΔE for influence range
- Strength parameter (0-100) controls maximum pull intensity
- Raised cosine falloff ensures smooth color transitions

### Multi-Attractor Blending 
Importance Score: 90
- Multiple attractors blend influences through normalized weighted averaging
- Weights determined by:
  - Perceptual distance to target color
  - Attractor strength
  - Tolerance radius
- Channel-specific transformations for luminance, saturation, and hue
- Special handling for circular hue blending using trigonometric means

### Channel Control
Importance Score: 85
- Independent control over luminance, saturation, and hue channels
- Selective channel transformation with others preserved
- Grayscale preservation for hue-only transformations
- Weight normalization system maintains color integrity

### Distance Calculations
Importance Score: 80
- Uses perceptual color difference (ΔE) in Oklab space
- Maximum influence threshold at 2.5 ΔE
- Linear mapping of tolerance values to perceptual distance
- Smooth falloff based on normalized distance

### Gamut Mapping
Importance Score: 75
- CSS Color Module 4 compliant gamut mapping
- Binary search on chroma to find displayable colors
- Preserves perceptual attributes during gamut correction
- Maintains color relationships while ensuring display validity

The model implements a "pull" rather than "replace" approach, creating natural color transitions based on perceptual similarity and specified parameters. This ensures smooth, intuitive color transformations while maintaining visual coherence.
