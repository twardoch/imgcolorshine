# attractor-model

## Core Color Attraction Model
The attractor model implements a physics-inspired color transformation system operating in OKLCH color space:

1. Attractor Definition (Score: 95)
- Each attractor specified by target color, tolerance radius, and strength
- Target colors defined in any CSS format, converted to OKLCH coordinates
- Tolerance controls maximum influence distance (0-100)
- Strength determines transformation intensity (0-100)

2. Distance-Based Influence (Score: 90)
- OKLCH perceptual distance calculations between pixels and attractors
- Raised cosine falloff curve for smooth influence transitions
- Independent channel control (lightness, chroma, hue)
- Normalized distance calculations in perceptually uniform space

3. Multi-Attractor Blending (Score: 85)
- Weighted influence blending from multiple attractors
- Normalized weights based on distance and strength
- Channel-specific transformation enabling/disabling
- Cumulative effect calculation with falloff curves

## Key Components

### Attractor Parameters
- Color: Target OKLCH coordinates
- Tolerance: Influence radius (0-100)
- Strength: Pull intensity (0-100)

### Distance Calculation
- Perceptual distance in OKLCH space
- Channel-specific delta calculations
- Normalized distance mapping

### Influence Blending
- Weighted average of attractor influences
- Smooth falloff transitions
- Channel-selective transformations

### Gamut Protection
- CSS Color Module 4 compliant mapping
- Preserves perceptual relationships
- Maintains channel independence
