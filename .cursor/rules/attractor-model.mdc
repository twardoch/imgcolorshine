# attractor-model

## Core Attractor Model Components (Importance: 95)

The attractor model implements a physics-inspired color transformation system using:

1. Perceptual Distance Calculation
- Calculates color similarity in OKLCH space between pixels and attractors
- Uses percentile-based tolerance to determine influence radius
- Implements raised cosine falloff for smooth transitions

2. Multi-Attractor Blending
- Combines influence from multiple attractors using weighted averaging
- Weights determined by perceptual distance and attractor strength
- Handles overlapping areas of influence gracefully

3. Channel-Specific Transformations
- Independent control over lightness, chroma and hue channels
- Channel-specific attraction strength modulation
- Preserves unmodified channels during transformation

## Attractor Parameters (Importance: 90)

1. Tolerance (0-100)
- Percentile-based radius of influence 
- 0% = no pixels affected
- 50% = affects half the pixels most similar to attractor
- 100% = affects all pixels
- Adapts to each image's unique color distribution

2. Strength (0-200)
- Controls transformation intensity
- 0-100: Progressive falloff based on distance
- 100-200: Overrides falloff curve
- Full strength (100) makes nearest pixels match attractor exactly

## Key Implementation Details (Importance: 85)

1. Distance-Based Influence
- Stronger influence on pixels more similar to attractor
- Continuous falloff based on perceptual distance
- Normalized weighting across multiple attractors

2. Perceptual Uniformity
- All operations performed in OKLCH space
- Ensures natural-looking transformations
- Maintains visual coherence of results
