## Overview

`imgcolorshine` is a high-performance image color transformation tool that uses a physics-inspired model to transform images. It works by defining "attractor" colors that pull the image's colors toward them, similar to gravitational attraction. All operations are performed in the perceptually uniform **OKLCH color space**, ensuring that transformations look natural and intuitive to the human eye.

### What Makes `imgcolorshine` Special?

1.  **Perceptually Uniform**: All transformations happen in OKLCH, where changes to lightness, chroma, and hue values correspond directly to how we perceive those qualities.
2.  **Physics-Inspired**: The gravitational model provides smooth, organic color transitions rather than abrupt replacements.
3.  **Blazing Fast**: Multiple optimization layers deliver 100x+ speedups through Numba JIT compilation, GPU acceleration, 3D LUT caching, and fused kernels.
4.  **Production Ready**: The tool includes a comprehensive test suite, professional-grade gamut mapping, and memory-efficient processing for large images.
5.  **Flexible**: Offers fine-grained control over which color channels to transform and how strongly to influence them.

## Key Features

- ‚ú® **Perceptually Uniform Color Space**: All operations in OKLCH for natural results.
- üé® **Universal Color Support**: Accepts any CSS color format (hex, rgb, hsl, oklch, named colors, etc.).
- üéØ **Multi-Attractor Blending**: Seamlessly combines the influence of multiple color attractors.
- üéõÔ∏è **Channel Control**: Transforms lightness, chroma, and hue independently.
- üèéÔ∏è **Multiple Acceleration Modes**: CPU (Numba), GPU (CuPy), and LUT-based processing.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

Transform an image to have a warmer tone by pulling its colors toward orange:

```bash
imgcolorshine shine photo.jpg "orange;50;75"
```

This command:
- Loads `photo.jpg`.
- Creates an `orange` color attractor.
- Sets the `tolerance` to `50` (influencing the 50% of pixels most similar to orange).
- Sets the `strength` to `75` (a noticeable but natural pull).
- Saves the result as `photo_colorshine.jpg`.

### Multiple Attractors

Create a sunset effect with multiple color influences:

```bash
imgcolorshine shine landscape.png \
  "oklch(80% 0.2 60);40;60" \
  "#ff6b35;30;80" \
  --output_image=sunset.png
```

### High-Performance Processing

For maximum speed on large images or batch processing:

```bash
# Use GPU acceleration (default: on if available)
imgcolorshine shine large_photo.jpg "purple;50;70" --gpu=True

# Build and use a 3D LUT for extremely fast processing
imgcolorshine shine photo.jpg "cyan;40;60" --lut_size=65

# Combine optimizations for best performance
imgcolorshine shine huge_image.jpg "red;45;65" \
  --gpu=True --lut_size=65 --fused_kernel=True
```

## Usage Guide

### Command Structure

```bash
imgcolorshine shine INPUT_IMAGE ATTRACTOR1 [ATTRACTOR2 ...] [OPTIONS]
```

### Attractor Format

Each attractor is a string with three parts separated by semicolons: `"color;tolerance;strength"`

-   **`color`**: Any valid CSS color string.
    -   Named: `"red"`, `"blue"`, `"forestgreen"`
    -   Hex: `"#ff0000"`, `"#00f"`
    -   RGB: `"rgb(255, 0, 0)"`, `"rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5)"`
    -   HSL: `"hsl(120, 100%, 50%)"`
    -   OKLCH: `"oklch(70% 0.2 120)"`

#### Tolerance (0‚Äì100)

This parameter determines the **range of influence** of your attractor.

-   **For Designers**: Think of `tolerance` as casting a net. A small tolerance (e.g., `10`) catches only colors that are very similar to your attractor. A large tolerance (e.g., `80`) casts a wide net, catching a broad range of colors and pulling all of them gently toward your target. A tolerance of `50` will affect the half of the image's colors that are most similar to your attractor. This makes the tool adaptive to each image's unique palette.

-   **Technical Explanation**: Tolerance is a **percentile** of an image's color distribution, calculated based on perceptual distance (Euclidean distance in Oklab space) from the attractor color. `tolerance=50` finds the median distance of all pixels to the attractor and uses that distance as the maximum radius of influence. Any pixel with a distance greater than this radius will not be affected.

#### Strength (0‚Äì200)

This parameter controls the **intensity** of the transformation.

-   **For Designers**: `strength` is how hard you pull the "net" of colors you've captured with `tolerance`.
    -   **`0‚Äì100` (Falloff Mode)**: A gentle tug. Colors closest to your attractor are pulled the hardest, and the pull's intensity smoothly "falls off" to zero for colors at the edge of the tolerance radius. A `strength` of `50` means that even the most similar colors will only move 50% of the way toward the attractor's color.
    -   **`101‚Äì200` (Duotone Mode)**: A powerful, uniform yank. In this range, the falloff effect is progressively flattened. At a `strength` of `200`, every color inside your tolerance net is pulled *completely* to the attractor's color, creating a flat, duotone-like effect within that specific color range.

-   **Technical Explanation**: Strength controls the interpolation factor between an original pixel's color and the attractor's color. The influence is modulated by a raised-cosine falloff function based on the normalized distance within the tolerance radius.
    -   For `strength <= 100`, the final weight is `(strength / 100) * falloff`.
    -   For `strength > 100`, the falloff is overridden. The weight is calculated as `falloff + (strength_extra * (1 - falloff))`, where `strength_extra` is the scaled value from 100 to 200. At 200, the weight is 1.0 for all pixels within the tolerance radius.

## How It Works

### The "Pull" Model

`imgcolorshine` uses a **"pull" model**, not a "replace" model. Instead of finding and replacing colors, it simulates a gravitational field where every pixel is gently pulled toward the defined attractor colors. This results in smooth, natural transitions that respect the original image's complexity.

### The Transformation Process

The process is designed for both correctness and performance:

1.  **Color Space Conversion**: The input image is converted from sRGB to the **Oklab** color space. All distance calculations happen here because Euclidean distance in Oklab closely approximates human perceptual color difference. The Oklab values are also converted to **OKLCH** (Lightness, Chroma, Hue) for intuitive channel-specific transformations.

2.  **Distance Analysis (The "Tolerance" Pass)**: For each attractor, the engine calculates the perceptual distance (ŒîE) from the attractor to *every pixel* in the image. It then finds the distance value that corresponds to the specified `tolerance` percentile. This value becomes the maximum radius of influence (`delta_e_max`).

3.  **Color Transformation (The "Strength" Pass)**: The engine iterates through the pixels again (via a single vectorized operation). For each pixel within an attractor's `delta_e_max` radius:
    a. It calculates a `weight` based on the pixel's distance from the attractor and the attractor's `strength`.
    b. The influence of all attractors is blended.
    c. The pixel's L, C, or H values are interpolated toward the blended attractor values.

4.  **Gamut Mapping**: After transformation, some colors may be "out of gamut" (i.e., not displayable on a standard sRGB screen). A CSS Color Module 4-compliant algorithm carefully brings these colors back into the sRGB gamut by reducing chroma while preserving hue and lightness, ensuring no color data is simply clipped.

5.  **Final Conversion**: The transformed, gamut-mapped image is converted from Oklab back to sRGB and saved.

## Performance

The core transformation engine is highly optimized for speed:

-   **Vectorization**: The main processing loop is fully vectorized with NumPy, eliminating slow, per-pixel Python loops and leveraging optimized C/Fortran routines for calculations.
-   **Numba**: Critical, hot-path functions like color space conversions and gamut mapping are Just-in-Time (JIT) compiled to native machine code by Numba, providing significant speedup.
-   **GPU Acceleration**: When available, transformations can be accelerated using CuPy for GPU processing, offering dramatic speedups for large images.
-   **LUT Acceleration**: For repeated transformations with the same settings, a 3D lookup table can be pre-computed and cached, enabling real-time performance.
-   **Fused Kernels**: An optional fused transformation kernel processes one pixel at a time through the entire pipeline, improving cache locality and reducing memory bandwidth.
-   **Mypyc**: Key modules are pre-compiled into C extensions using Mypyc to reduce Python interpreter overhead.

The refactored codebase is optimized for correctness and maintainability. Performance is enhanced through:
-   **Numba**: Critical numerical loops are JIT-compiled to C-like speed.
-   **Mypyc**: Core modules are compiled into native C extensions, removing Python interpreter overhead.
-   **GPU Acceleration**: CuPy backend for 10-100x speedups on NVIDIA GPUs.
-   **3D LUT**: Pre-computed transformations with trilinear interpolation for 5-20x speedups.
-   **Fused Kernels**: Single-pass pixel transformation keeping operations in CPU registers.

On a modern machine:
- A 2048√ó2048 pixel image processes in 2-4 seconds (CPU)
- With GPU acceleration: <0.5 seconds
- With cached LUT: <0.2 seconds
- Combined optimizations: <10ms for 1920√ó1080 images
