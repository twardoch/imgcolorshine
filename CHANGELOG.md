### Major Refactoring and Optimization Sprint

This release represents a massive refactoring and optimization effort that has transformed `imgcolorshine` into a stable, maintainable, and exceptionally high-performance tool.

#### Phase 0: Triage and Repair
- Fixed critical errors preventing test collection
- Removed non-existent `test_tolerance.py` import
- Fixed missing `is_in_gamut_srgb` export by refactoring `trans_numba.py`
  - Renamed internal `_in_gamut` to public `is_in_gamut_srgb`
  - Updated all references throughout the codebase

#### Phase 1: Code Cleanup and Refactoring
- **Fixed Boolean Positional Arguments**: Added `*` to enforce keyword-only arguments across all functions
- **Removed Magic Numbers**: Created module-level constants for clarity
  - `ATTRACTOR_PARTS`, `TOLERANCE_MIN/MAX`, `STRENGTH_MIN/MAX`
  - `STRENGTH_TRADITIONAL_MAX`, `FULL_CIRCLE_DEGREES`
- **Fixed Type Errors**: 
  - Added missing return type annotations
  - Added type ignore comments for `numba.prange` and untyped imports
  - Fixed `fire` import type issues
- **Variable Naming**: Standardized lightness variable naming (using 'L' consistently)

#### Phase 2: Core Logic Consolidation
- **Removed Dead Code**: Deleted the entire `process_with_optimizations` function and related dead code paths

- Dependencies: click, coloraide, opencv-python, numpy, numba, pillow, loguru, rich
- Modular architecture with separate modules for each concern
- JIT compilation for performance-critical code paths

### Added / Behavioural Changes

- **Extended Strength Range (0-200)**  
  The `strength` parameter for each attractor now accepts values up to **200**.  
  
  â€¢ **0-100** â€“ behaves exactly as before; weight = strength Ã— raised-cosine fall-off.  
  â€¢ **100-200** â€“ gradually flattens the fall-off curve. At 200 every pixel *within the tolerance radius* is pulled with full weight (duotone effect).

  Implementation details:
  - Weight computation moved to `engine._calculate_weights_percentile()`.
  - For `strength > 100` an extra factor `s_extra = (strength-100)/100` blends the fall-off value with 1.0.
  - CLI validator in `colorshine.parse_attractor()` now allows 0-200.

  This enables one-knob transition from subtle grading to complete duotone without changing tolerance.
