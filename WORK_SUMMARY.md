# Work Summary - imgcolorshine

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Restructured PLAN.md
- Added numbered headings and checkable boxes to all sections
- Made the plan more actionable and trackable
- All phases (0-5) are now marked as complete

### 2. Phase 5.1: Write Correctness Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_engine_correctness.py`
- 8 tests covering all major aspects of the engine:
  - Tolerance behavior (0%, 100%, percentile-based)
  - Strength effects (0, blending levels, 200% no-falloff mode)
  - Channel-specific transformations (L, C, H flags)
  - Multiple attractor blending
- Fixed misconceptions in existing tests about how tolerance and strength work
- All tests now pass successfully

### 3. Phase 5.2: Update Documentation
- **README.md** updates:
  - Added new command options: `--gpu`, `--lut_size`, `--fused_kernel`
  - Added "High-Performance Processing" section with examples
  - Updated Performance section with details on all optimization methods
  - Updated Architecture section to include new modules (lut.py, numba_utils.py)
  - Added performance benchmarks for GPU and LUT modes
  
- **CHANGELOG.md** updates:
  - Added new section for today's work
  - Documented the comprehensive test suite additions
  - Documented all documentation updates
  - Fixed test suite corrections

- **CLI Help** was already up-to-date with all the new flags

## Code Quality
- Ran all Python formatting/linting commands as specified in CLAUDE.md
- Fixed formatting issues in the new test file
- All tests pass with proper assertions
