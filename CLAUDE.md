# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
# When you write code
- Iterate gradually, avoiding major changes
- Minimize confirmations and checks
- Preserve existing code/structure unless necessary
- Use constants over magic numbers
- Check for existing solutions in the codebase before starting
- Check often the coherence of the code you‚Äôre writing with the rest of the code.
- Focus on minimal viable increments and ship early
- Write explanatory docstrings/comments that explain what and WHY this does, explain where and how the code is used/referred to elsewhere in the code
- Analyze code line-by-line
- Handle failures gracefully with retries, fallbacks, user guidance
- Address edge cases, validate assumptions, catch errors early
- Let the computer do the work, minimize user decisions
- Reduce cognitive load, beautify code
- Modularize repeated logic into concise, single-purpose functions
- Favor flat over nested structures
- Consistently keep, document, update and consult the holistic overview mental image of the codebase. 
## 1. Keep track of paths
In each source file, maintain the up-to-date `this_file` record that shows the path of the current file relative to project root. Place the `this_file` record near the top of the file, as a comment after the shebangs, or in the YAML Markdown frontmatter.
## 2. When you write Python
- Use `uv pip`, never `pip`
- Use `python -m` when running code
- PEP 8: Use consistent formatting and naming
- Write clear, descriptive names for functions and variables
- PEP 20: Keep code simple and explicit. Prioritize readability over cleverness
- Use type hints in their simplest form (list, dict, | for unions)
- PEP 257: Write clear, imperative docstrings
- Use f-strings. Use structural pattern matching where appropriate
- ALWAYS add "verbose" mode logugu-based logging, & debug-log
- For CLI Python scripts, use fire & rich, and start the script with
```
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run -s
# /// script
# dependencies = ["PKG1", "PKG2"]
# ///
# this_file: PATH_TO_CURRENT_FILE
```
Work in rounds: 
- Create `PLAN.md` as a detailed flat plan with `[ ]` items. 
- Identify the most important TODO items, and create `TODO.md` with `[ ]` items. 
- Implement the changes. 
- Update `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md` as you go. 
- After each round of changes, update `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes.
- Update `README.md` to reflect the changes.
Ask before extending/refactoring existing code in a way that may add complexity or break things.
When you‚Äôre finished, print "Wait, but" to go back, think & reflect, revise & improvement what you‚Äôve done (but don‚Äôt invent functionality freely). Repeat this. But stick to the goal of "minimal viable next version". Lead two experts: "Ideot" for creative, unorthodox ideas, and "Critin" to critique flawed thinking and moderate for balanced discussions. The three of you shall illuminate knowledge with concise, beautiful responses, process methodically for clear answers, collaborate step-by-step, sharing thoughts and adapting. If errors are found, step back and focus on accuracy and progress.
## 3. After Python changes run:
```
fd -e py -x autoflake -i {}; fd -e py -x pyupgrade --py311-plus {}; fd -e py -x ruff check --output-format=github --fix --unsafe-fixes {}; fd -e py -x ruff format --respect-gitignore --target-version py311 {}; python -m pytest;
```
Be creative, diligent, critical, relentless & funny!
# imgcolorshine
Transform image colors using OKLCH color attractors - a physics-inspired tool that operates in perceptually uniform color space.
`imgcolorshine` is a high-performance image color transformation tool that uses a physics-inspired model to transform images. It works by defining "attractor" colors that pull the image's colors toward them, similar to gravitational attraction. All operations are performed in the perceptually uniform OKLCH color space, ensuring natural and visually pleasing results.
1. **Perceptually Uniform**: Uses OKLCH color space for intuitive, natural-looking transformations
2. **Physics-Inspired**: Gravitational model provides smooth, organic color transitions
3. **Blazing Fast**: 100x+ faster than naive implementations through multiple optimization layers
4. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive test suite, professional gamut mapping, memory efficient
5. **Flexible**: Fine-grained control over color channels and transformation parameters

## 6. Quick Start
### 6.1. Basic Usage
Transform an image to have a warmer tone:
```bash
imgcolorshine shine photo.jpg "orange;50;75"
```
This command:
- Loads `photo.jpg`

### 6.2. Multiple Attractors
Create a sunset effect with multiple color influences:
```bash
imgcolorshine shine landscape.png \
  "oklch(80% 0.2 60);40;60" \
  "#ff6b35;30;80" \
  --output_image=sunset.png
```
## 7. Usage Guide
### 7.1. Command Structure
```bash
imgcolorshine shine INPUT_IMAGE ATTRACTOR1 [ATTRACTOR2 ...] [OPTIONS]
```
### 7.2. Attractor Format
Each attractor is specified as: `"color;tolerance;strength"`
- **color**: Any CSS color
  - Named: `"red"`, `"blue"`, `"forestgreen"`
  - Hex: `"#ff0000"`, `"#00ff00"`
  - RGB: `"rgb(255, 0, 0)"`, `"rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5)"`
  - HSL: `"hsl(120, 100%, 50%)"`
  - OKLCH: `"oklch(70% 0.2 120)"`
- **tolerance** (0-100): Radius of influence
  - 0-20: Only very similar colors affected
  - 30-60: Moderate range of influence
  - 70-100: Broad influence across many colors
- **strength** (0-200): Transformation intensity
  - 0-30: Subtle shifts, original color dominates
  - 40-70: Noticeable but natural transformations
  - 80-100: Strong pull toward attractor (fall-off still applies)
  - 100-200: Extended range ‚Äì progressively flattens the fall-off curve
Tolerance of 0% influences no pixels, tolerance of 100% influences all pixels, and tolerance of 50% influences that half of the pixels that are more similar to the attractor than the other half. 
The actual influence of the attractor onto a given pixel should always stronger if the pixel is more similar to the attractor, and less strong if it's less similar. 
The strength of 100% means that the influence of the attractor onto the pixels that are most similar to the attractor is full, that is, these pixels take on the hue and/or saturation and/or luminance of the attractor. But for pixels that are less similar, there's a falloff. 
Aa strength of 50% means that the influence is 50% but only on the most similar pixels, that is, the new value of H or S or L becomes 50% of the old one and 50% of the new one. But the strength of the influence always falls off, the less similar the pixel is to the attractor. 
The strength of 200% means there is no falloff: the influence is always full within the tolerance. 
### 7.3. Command Options
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--output_image` | PATH | Auto | Output file path |
| `--luminance` | BOOL | True | Transform lightness channel |
| `--saturation` | BOOL | True | Transform chroma channel |
| `--hue` | BOOL | True | Transform hue channel |
| `--verbose` | BOOL | False | Enable detailed logging |
| `--tile_size` | INT | 1024 | Tile size for large images |
| `--gpu` | BOOL | True | Use GPU if available |
| `--lut_size` | INT | 0 | 3D LUT size (0=disabled, 65=recommended) |
| `--hierarchical` | BOOL | False | Multi-resolution processing |
| `--spatial_accel` | BOOL | True | Spatial acceleration structures |
### 7.4. Advanced Examples
#### 7.4.1. Channel-Specific Transformation
Transform only the hue, preserving lightness and saturation:
```bash
imgcolorshine shine portrait.jpg "teal;60;80" \
  --luminance=False --saturation=False
```
#### 7.4.2. High-Performance Processing
For maximum speed on repeated transformations:
```bash
# Build and cache a 3D LUT for fast processing
imgcolorshine shine photo.jpg "purple;50;70" --lut_size=65
# Use GPU acceleration
imgcolorshine shine photo.jpg "cyan;40;60" --gpu=True
# Combine optimizations
imgcolorshine shine large_image.jpg "red;45;65" \
  --gpu=True --lut_size=65 --hierarchical=True
```
#### 7.4.3. Batch Processing
Process multiple images with the same transformation:
```bash
for img in *.jpg; do
  imgcolorshine shine "$img" "seagreen;55;75" \
    --output_image="processed/${img}"
done
```
## 8. How It Works
### 8.1. The Attraction Model: "Pull" vs "Replace"
`imgcolorshine` uses a **"pull" model**, not a "replace" model. Colors are gradually pulled toward attractors, creating natural, smooth transitions.
### 8.2. The Transformation Process
1.  **Color Space**: All operations happen in the perceptually uniform OKLCH color space.
2.  **Attraction Model**: Each attractor's influence is determined by:
    -   **Tolerance (0-100)**: This is a **percentile**. `tolerance=50` means the attractor will influence the 50% of the image's pixels that are most similar to it. This makes the effect adaptive to each image's unique color palette.
    -   **Strength (0-200)**: This controls the **intensity of the pull** ‚Äì and, beyond 100, how much the raised-cosine fall-off is overridden.
3.  **Blending**: Influences from multiple attractors are blended using a normalized, weighted average.
4.  **Gamut Mapping**: Any resulting colors that are outside the displayable sRGB gamut are carefully mapped back in, preserving the perceived color as much as possible.
## 9. Performance
The refactored codebase is optimized for correctness and maintainability. Performance is enhanced through:
-   **Numba**: Critical numerical loops are JIT-compiled to C-like speed.
-   **Mypyc**: Core modules are compiled into native C extensions, removing Python interpreter overhead.
A 2048x2048 image is processed in a few seconds on a modern machine.

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

2. OKLCH Color Pipeline (95/100) 
- All operations performed in perceptually uniform OKLCH space
- Professional gamut mapping compliant with CSS Color Module 4
- Independent control over lightness, chroma and hue channels

3. Multi-Attractor Blending System (85/100)
- Combines influences from multiple attractors using normalized weighted average
- Smooth transitions between attractor influences
- Handles falloff curves and strength ratios between attractors

4. Color Transformation Workflow (80/100)

If you work with Python, use 'uv pip' instead of 'pip', and use 'uvx hatch test' instead of 'python -m pytest'. 

When I say /report, you must: Read all `./TODO.md` and `./PLAN.md` files and analyze recent changes. Document all changes in `./CHANGELOG.md`. From `./TODO.md` and `./PLAN.md` remove things that are done. Make sure that `./PLAN.md` contains a detailed, clear plan that discusses specifics, while `./TODO.md` is its flat simplified itemized `- [ ]`-prefixed representation. When I say /work, you must work in iterations like so: Read all `./TODO.md` and `./PLAN.md` files and reflect. Work on the tasks. Think, contemplate, research, reflect, refine, revise. Be careful, curious, vigilant, energetic. Verify your changes. Think aloud. Consult, research, reflect. Then update `./PLAN.md` and `./TODO.md` with tasks that will lead to improving the work you‚Äôve just done. Then '/report', and then iterate again.
